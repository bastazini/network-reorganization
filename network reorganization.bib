Abstract = {Global climate change threatens to substantially rearrange species
   interactions, yet we lack clear predictions on how these changes will
   cascade through communities. Many perturbations associated with climate
   change, such as droughts, will change resource levels, with consequences
   for species interactions and thus ecological network structure. Diet
   theory predicts foraging niche expansion when preferred resources are
   scarce, yet under severe resource reduction interspecific competition
   could alternatively increase niche partitioning. Such niche expansion
   and/or contraction could profoundly shape ecological network structure
   following perturbations, but whether these predictions hold at the
   community level is unclear. We studied the impacts of drought on
   plant-pollinator networks in long-lived perennial plant communities in
   which drought affects flower and floral reward production. We assessed
   whether drought effects on available floral resources altered pollinator
   dietary niche breadth to drive higher network-level generalization.
   Accounting for interaction abundance and species turnover, we compared
   plant-pollinator networks in two drought years and three non-drought
   years. We found that drought restructured plant-pollinator networks,
   resulting in more generalization in terms of presence-absence of links,
   yet more specialization when accounting for quantitative network
   intensities. Our results support the application of diet theory to
   understanding how perturbations may impact ecological network structure.},

Abstract = {The authors investigate the impact of warming and nutrient supply on
   entire ecological networks within ten Swiss lakes. Warming generally
   reduces network interactions, particularly under high phosphate, leading
   to shifts in trophic control of food webs.
   Climate change interacts with local processes to threaten biodiversity
   by disrupting the complex network of ecological interactions. While
   changes in network interactions drastically affect ecosystems, how
   ecological networks respond to climate change, in particular warming and
   nutrient supply fluctuations, is largely unknown. Here, using an
   equation-free modelling approach on monthly plankton community data in
   ten Swiss lakes, we show that the number and strength of plankton
   community interactions fluctuate and respond nonlinearly to water
   temperature and phosphorus. While lakes show system-specific responses,
   warming generally reduces network interactions, particularly under high
   phosphate levels. This network reorganization shifts trophic control of
   food webs, leading to consumers being controlled by resources. Small
   grazers and cyanobacteria emerge as sensitive indicators of changes in
   plankton networks. By exposing the outcomes of a complex interplay
   between environmental drivers, our results provide tools for studying
   and advancing our understanding of how climate change impacts entire
   ecological communities.},

Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {Several marine ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure have experienced
   shifts from one ecological state to another. In the central Baltic Sea,
   the regime shift of the 1980s has been associated with food-web
   reorganization and redirection of energy flow pathways. These long-term
   dynamics from 1974 to 2006 have been simulated here using a food-web
   model forced by climate and fishing. Ecological network analysis was
   performed to calculate indices of ecosystem change. The model replicated
   the regime shift. The analyses of indicators suggested that the system's
   resilience was higher prior to 1988 and lower thereafter. The ecosystem
   topology also changed from a web-like structure to a linearized
   food-web.},

Title = {Phylogenetic rewiring in mycorrhizal-plant interaction networks
   increases community stability in naturally fragmented landscapes},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Although ecological networks are usually considered a static
   representation of species' interactions, the interactions can change
   when the preferred partners are absent (rewiring). In mutualistic
   networks, rewiring with non-preferred partners can palliate extinction
   cascades, contributing to communities' stability. In spite of its
   significance, whether general patterns can shape the rewiring of
   ecological interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show a
   phylogenetic constraint in the rewiring of mycorrhizal networks, so that
   rewired interactions (i.e., with non-preferred hosts) tend to involve
   close relatives of preferred hosts. Despite this constraint, rewiring
   increases the robustness of the fungal community to the simulated loss
   of their host species. We identify preferred and non-preferred hosts
   based on the probability that, when the two partners co-occur, they
   actually interact. Understanding general patterns in the rewiring of
   interactions can improve our predictions of community responses to
   interactions' loss, which influences how global changes will affect
   ecosystem stability.},

Title = {Dispersal governs the reorganization of ecological networks under
   environmental change},
Journal = {NATURE ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {1},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ecological networks, such as food webs, mutualist webs and host-parasite
   webs, are reorganizing as species abundances and spatial distributions
   shift in response to environmental change. Current theoretical
   expectations for how this reorganization will occur are available for
   competition or for parts of interaction networks, but these may not
   extend to more complex networks. Here we use metacommunity theory to
   develop new expectations for how complex networks will reorganize under
   environmental change, and show that dispersal is crucial for determining
   the degree to which networks will retain their composition and
   structure. When dispersal between habitat patches is low, all types of
   species interactions act as a strong determinant for whether species can
   colonize suitable habitats. This colonization resistance drives species
   turnover, which breaks apart current networks and leads to the formation
   of new networks. However, when dispersal rates are increased, colonists
   arrive in high abundance in habitats where they are well adapted, so
   interactions with resident species contribute less to colonization
   success. Dispersal ensures that species associations are maintained as
   they shift in space, so networks retain similar composition and
   structure. The crucial role of dispersal reinforces the need to manage
   habitat connectivity to sustain species and interaction diversity into
   the future.},

Title = {Trophic compression of lake food webs under hydrologic disturbance},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The need to protect biostructure is increasingly recognized, yet
   empirical studies of how human exploits affect ecological networks are
   rare. Studying the effects of variation in human disturbance intensity
   from decades past can help us understand and anticipate ecosystem change
   under alleviated or amplified disturbance over decades to come. Here, we
   use stable isotopes and an innovative analytical approach to compare the
   food webs of two akin lake ecosystems subject to disparate water use
   regimes, a pervasive, yet unappreciated stressor. We show that intensive
   water use (persistent, early season, rapid lake-level drawdown) can
   compress trophic diversity by 46\%, necessitating reorganization of
   biostructural elements configuring lake food webs. Compression occurred
   over the delta C-13 axis indicating erosion of basal trophic diversity,
   but food chain length remained intact over the period and intensity of
   disturbance examined. This study demonstrates the potential for water
   use, like other disturbances (warming, eutrophication, and invasive
   species), to mute opportunity for benthic-pelagic coupling and benefits
   to lake food webs and the inherent capacity of lake ecosystems to adapt
   to stress. Trophically compressed lakes may be less able to adapt to
   intensified water use.},

Title = {Plants, pollinators and their interactions under global ecological
   change: The role of pollen DNA metabarcoding},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 26},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities are triggering global changes in the
   environment, causing entire communities of plants, pollinators and their
   interactions to restructure, and ultimately leading to species declines.
   To understand the mechanisms behind community shifts and declines, as
   well as monitoring and managing impacts, a global effort must be made to
   characterize plant-pollinator communities in detail, across different
   habitat types, latitudes, elevations, and levels and types of
   disturbances. Generating data of this scale will only be feasible with
   rapid, high-throughput methods. Pollen DNA metabarcoding provides
   advantages in throughput, efficiency and taxonomic resolution over
   traditional methods, such as microscopic pollen identification and
   visual observation of plant-pollinator interactions. This makes it ideal
   for understanding complex ecological networks and their responses to
   change. Pollen DNA metabarcoding is currently being applied to assess
   plant-pollinator interactions, survey ecosystem change and model the
   spatiotemporal distribution of allergenic pollen. Where samples are
   available from past collections, pollen DNA metabarcoding has been used
   to compare contemporary and past ecosystems. New avenues of research are
   possible with the expansion of pollen DNA metabarcoding to intraspecific
   identification, analysis of DNA in ancient pollen samples, and increased
   use of museum and herbarium specimens. Ongoing developments in
   sequencing technologies can accelerate progress towards these goals.
   Global ecological change is happening rapidly, and we anticipate that
   high-throughput methods such as pollen DNA metabarcoding are critical
   for understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes that support
   biodiversity, and predicting and responding to the impacts of change.},

Title = {The structure of ecological state transitions: Amplification,
   synchronization, and constraints in responses to environmental change},

Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {336-346},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Effects of environmental change may be either amplified and facilitated,
   or constrained, by the network of state-changes in ecological systems.
   Network structure affects system response independently of the dynamics
   of the individual subsystems. Ecological responses were represented as
   state-and-transition models (STMs), and analyzed as mathematical graphs.
   Three metrics were applied that reflect: (1) the extent to which
   environmental change is amplified or filtered by state transitions; (2)
   network synchronizability and the rate of propagation of state changes;
   and (3) the extent of system structural constraints to the spatial
   propagation of state transitions. These were determined for seven
   archetypal graph structures representing common forms of connectivity in
   ecological networks, and linked to distinct modes of ecological change.
   Radiation-type structures are the least synchronized and most
   constrained patterns, with the most limited amplification, followed by
   other low-connectivity patterns such as those associated with monotonic
   succession. The maximum-connectivity rigid polygon structure (any state
   can transition to any other) has the strongest amplification and
   synchronization and least constraints. Structural constraints to change
   propagation are most sensitive to increasing numbers of transitions for
   a given number of states, and synchronization also increases at least
   linearly with the number of links. Amplification, however, does not
   increases as rapidly; as long as a graph is connected, increasing the
   number of links does not proportionally increase it. Because the more
   densely connected structures have much higher synchronization than other
   patterns, and fewer constraints on change propagation, environments
   characterized by these types of STMs may be prone to rapid, complex
   transitions in response to environmental changes. STMs for rangelands in
   two regions of Texas show that the rigid polygon structure is very
   common. If this phenomenon is more general, it suggests that relatively
   abrupt landscape reorganizations may be more likely than more orderly
   successions of change along environmental gradients. This analysis shows
   that identification of STMs and their network structure is useful for
   recognizing environments at higher risk for complex reorganization, and
   for identification of management actions to either retard or facilitate
   propagation of state changes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Climate change is altering ecological and evolutionary processes across
   biological scales. These simultaneous effects of climate change pose a
   major challenge for predicting the future state of populations,
   communities and ecosystems. This challenge is further exacerbated by the
   current lack of integration of research focused on these different
   scales. We propose that integrating the fields of quantitative genetics
   and food web ecology will reveal new insights on how climate change may
   reorganize biodiversity across levels of organization. This is because
   quantitative genetics links the genotypes of individuals to
   population-level phenotypic variation due to genetic (G), environmental
   (E) and gene-by-environment (G x E) factors. Food web ecology, on the
   other hand, links population-level phenotypes to the structure and
   dynamics of communities and ecosystems. We synthesize data and theory
   across these fields and find evidence that genetic (G) and plastic (E
   and G x E) phenotypic variation within populations will change in
   magnitude under new climates in predictable ways. We then show how
   changes in these sources of phenotypic variation can rewire food webs by
   altering the number and strength of species interactions, with
   consequences for ecosystem resilience. We also find evidence suggesting
   there are predictable asymmetries in genetic and plastic trait variation
   across trophic levels, which set the pace for phenotypic change and food
   web responses to climate change. Advances in genomics now make it
   possible to partition G, E and G x E phenotypic variation in natural
   populations, allowing tests of the hypotheses we propose. By
   synthesizing advances in quantitative genetics and food web ecology, we
   provide testable predictions for how the structure and dynamics of
   biodiversity will respond to climate change.},

Abstract = {Climate warming can restructure lake food webs if trophic levels differ
   in their thermal responses, but evidence for these changes and their
   underlying mechanisms remain scarce in nature. Here we document how
   warming lake temperatures by up to 2 degrees C, rather than changes in
   trophic state or fishing effort, have restructured the pelagic food web
   of a large European lake (Lake Maggiore, Italy). Our approach exploited
   abundance and biomass data collected weekly to yearly across five
   trophic levels from 1981 to 2008. Temperature generally had stronger
   effects on taxa than changes in fish predation or trophic state mediated
   through primary productivity. Consequently, we found that, as the lake
   warmed, the food web shifted in numerical abundance towards predators
   occupying middle trophic positions. Of these taxa, the spiny water flea
   (Bythotrephes longimanus) most prospered. Bythotrephes strongly limited
   abundances of the keystone grazer Daphnia, strengthening top-down
   structuring of the food web. Warmer temperatures partly restructured the
   food web by advancing peak Bythotrephes densities by approximately 60
   days and extending periods of positive population growth by three times.
   Nonetheless, our results suggested that advances in the timing and size
   of peak Bythotrephes densities could not outpace changes in the timing
   and size of peak densities in their Daphnia prey. Our results provide
   rare evidence from nature as to how long-term warming can favour higher
   trophic levels, with the potential to strengthen top-down control of
   food webs.},

Title = {Changes in host-parasitoid food web structure with elevation},

Abstract = {1 .Gradients in elevation are increasingly used to investigate how
   species respond to changes in local climatic conditions. Whilst many
   studies have shown elevational patterns in species richness and
   turnover, little is known about how food web structure is affected by
   elevation.
   Contrasting responses of predator and prey species to elevation may lead
   to changes in food web structure. We investigated how the quantitative
   structure of a herbivore-parasitoid food web changes with elevation in
   an Australian subtropical rain forest.
   On four occasions, spread over 1year, we hand-collected leaf miners at
   twelve sites, along three elevational gradients (between 493m and 1159m
   a.s.l). A total of 5030 insects, including 603 parasitoids, were reared,
   and summary food webs were created for each site. We also carried out a
   replicated manipulative experiment by translocating an abundant
   leaf-mining weevil Platynotocis sp., which largely escaped parasitism at
   high elevations (900m a.s.l.), to lower, warmer elevations, to test if
   it would experience higher parasitism pressure.
   We found strong evidence that the environmental change that occurs with
   increasing elevation affects food web structure. Quantitative measures
   of generality, vulnerability and interaction evenness decreased
   significantly with increasing elevation (and decreasing temperature),
   whilst elevation did not have a significant effect on connectance. Mined
   plant composition also had a significant effect on generality and
   vulnerability, but not on interaction evenness. Several relatively
   abundant species of leaf miner appeared to escape parasitism at higher
   elevations, but contrary to our prediction, Platynotocis sp. did not
   experience greater levels of parasitism when translocated to lower
   elevations.
   Our study indicates that leaf-mining herbivores and their parasitoids
   respond differently to environmental conditions imposed by elevation,
   thus producing structural changes in their food webs. Increasing
   temperatures and changes in vegetation communities that are likely to
   result from climate change may have a restructuring effect on
   host-parasitoid food webs. Our translocation experiment, however,
   indicated that leaf miners currently escaping parasitism at high

Abstract = {Riverine habitats are vulnerable to a host of environmental stressors,
   many of which are increasing in frequency and intensity across the
   globe. Climate change is arguably the greatest threat on the horizon,
   with serious implications for freshwater food webs via alterations in
   thermal regimes, resource quality and availability, and hydrology. This
   will induce radical restructuring of many food webs, by altering the
   identity of nodes, the strength and patterning of interactions and
   consequently the dynamics and architecture of the trophic network as a
   whole. Although such effects are likely to be apparent globally, they
   are predicted to be especially rapid and dramatic in high altitude and
   latitude ecosystems, which represent `sentinel systems'. The complex and
   subtle connections between members of a food web and potential
   synergistic interactions with other environmental stressors can lead to
   seemingly counterintuitive responses to perturbations that cannot be
   predicted from the traditional focus of studying individual species in
   isolation. In this review, we highlight the need for developing new
   network-based approaches to understand and predict the consequences of
   global change in running waters.},

Abstract = {Climate change is asymmetrically altering environmental conditions in
   space, from local to global scales, creating novel heterogeneity. Here,
   we argue that this novel heterogeneity will drive mobile generalist
   consumer species to rapidly respond through their behaviour in ways that
   broadly and predictably reorganize - or rewire - food webs. We use
   existing theory and data from diverse ecosystems to show that the rapid
   behavioural responses of generalists to climate change rewire food webs
   in two distinct and critical ways. First, mobile generalist species are
   redistributing into systems where they were previously absent and
   foraging on new prey, resulting in topological rewiring - a change in
   the patterning of food webs due to the addition or loss of connections.
   Second, mobile generalist species, which navigate between habitats and
   ecosystems to forage, will shift their relative use of differentially
   altered habitats and ecosystems, causing interaction strength rewiring -
   changes that reroute energy and carbon flows through existing food web
   connections and alter the food web's interaction strengths. We then show
   that many species with shared traits can exhibit unified aggregate
   behavioural responses to climate change, which may allow us to
   understand the rewiring of whole food webs. We end by arguing that
   generalists' responses present a powerful and underutilized approach to
   understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change and may
   serve as much-needed early warning signals for monitoring the looming
   impacts of global climate change on entire ecosystems.},

Title = {Combined effects of global climate change and regional ecosystem drivers

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {19},
Number = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Changes in climate, in combination with intensive exploitation of marine
   resources, have caused large-scale reorganizations in many of the
   world's marine ecosystems during the past decades. The Baltic Sea in
   Northern Europe is one of the systems most affected. In addition to
   being exposed to persistent eutrophication, intensive fishing, and one
   of the world's fastest rates of warming in the last two decades of the
   20th century, accelerated climate change including atmospheric warming
   and changes in precipitation is projected for this region during the
   21st century. Here, we used a new multimodel approach to project how the
   interaction of climate, nutrient loads, and cod fishing may affect the
   future of the open Central Baltic Sea food web. Regionally downscaled
   global climate scenarios were, in combination with three nutrient load
   scenarios, used to drive an ensemble of three regional biogeochemical
   models (BGMs). An Ecopath with Ecosim food web model was then forced
   with the BGM results from different nutrient-climate scenarios in
   combination with two different cod fishing scenarios. The results showed
   that regional management is likely to play a major role in determining
   the future of the Baltic Sea ecosystem. By the end of the 21st century,
   for example, the combination of intensive cod fishing and high nutrient
   loads projected a strongly eutrophicated and sprat-dominated ecosystem,
   whereas low cod fishing in combination with low nutrient loads resulted
   in a cod-dominated ecosystem with eutrophication levels close to
   present. Also, nonlinearities were observed in the sensitivity of
   different trophic groups to nutrient loads or fishing depending on the
   combination of the two. Finally, many climate variables and species
   biomasses were projected to levels unseen in the past. Hence, the risk
   for ecological surprises needs to be addressed, particularly when the
   results are discussed in the ecosystem-based management context.},

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that global warming will adversely affect
   ecological communities. As ecosystems are simultaneously exposed to
   other anthropogenic influences, it is important to address the effects
   of climate change in the context of many stressors. Nutrient enrichment
   might offset some of the energy demands that warming can exert on
   organisms by stimulating growth at the base of the food web. It is
   important to know whether indirect effects of warming will be as
   ecologically significant as direct physiological effects. Declining body
   size is increasingly viewed as a universal response to warming, with the
   potential to alter trophic interactions. To address these issues, we
   used an outdoor array of marine mesocosms to examine the impacts of
   warming, nutrient enrichment and altered top-predator body size on a
   community comprised of the predator (shore crab Carcinus maenas),
   various grazing detritivores (amphipods) and algal resources. Warming
   increased mortality rates of crabs, but had no effect on their moulting
   rates. Nutrient enrichment and warming had near diametrically opposed
   effects on the assemblage, confirming that the ecological effects of
   these two stressors can cancel each other out. This suggests that
   nutrient-enriched systems might act as an energy refuge to populations
   of species under metabolic constraints due to warming. While there was a
   strong difference in assemblages between mesocosms containing crabs
   compared to mesocosms without crabs, decreasing crab size had no
   detectable effect on the amphipod or algal assemblages. This suggests
   that in allometrically balanced communities, the expected long-term
   effect of warming (declining body size) is not of similar ecological
   consequence to the direct physiological effects of warming, at least not
   over the six week duration of the experiment described here. More
   research is needed to determine the long-term effects of declining body
   size on the bioenergetic balance of natural communities.},

Abstract = {Droughts are intensifying across the globe(1,2), with potentially
   devastating implications for freshwater ecosystems(3,4). We used new
   network science approaches to investigate drought impacts on stream food
   webs and explored potential consequences for web robustness to future
   perturbations. The substructure of the webs was characterized by a core
   of richly connected species(5) surrounded by poorly connected peripheral
   species. Although drought caused the partial collapse of the food
   webs(6), the loss of the most extinction-prone peripheral species
   triggered a substantial rewiring of interactions within the networks'
   cores. These shifts in species interactions in the core conserved the
   underlying core/periphery substructure and stability of the
   drought-impacted webs. When we subsequently perturbed the webs by
   simulating species loss in silico, the rewired drought webs were as
   robust as the larger, undisturbed webs. Our research unearths previously
   unknown compensatory dynamics arising from within the core that could
   underpin food web stability in the face of environmental perturbations.},

Abstract = {Food webs unfold across a mosaic of micro and macro habitats, with each
   habitat coupled by mobile consumers that behave in response to local
   environmental conditions. Despite this fundamental characteristic of
   nature, research on how climate change will affect whole ecosystems has
   overlooked (i) that climate warming will generally affect habitats
   differently and (ii) that mobile consumers may respond to this
   differential change in a manner that may fundamentally alter the energy
   pathways that sustain ecosystems. This reasoning suggests a powerful,
   but largely unexplored, avenue for studying the impacts of climate
   change on ecosystem functioning. Here, we use lake ecosystems to show
   that predictable behavioral adjustments to local temperature
   differentials govern a fundamental structural shift across 54 food webs.
   Data show that the trophic pathways from basal resources to a
   cold-adapted predator shift toward greater reliance on a cold-water
   refuge habitat, and food chain length increases, as air temperatures
   rise. Notably, cold-adapted predator behavior may substantially drive
   this decoupling effect across the climatic range in our study
   independent of warmer-adapted species responses (for example, changes in
   near-shore species abundance and predator absence). Such modifications
   reflect a flexible food web architecture that requires more attention
   from climate change research. The trophic pathway restructuring
   documented here is expected to alter biomass accumulation, through the
   regulation of energy fluxes to predators, and thus potentially threatens
   ecosystem sustainability in times of rapid environmental change.},

Abstract = {Increased global temperatures caused by climate change are causing
   species to shift their ranges and colonize new sites, creating novel
   assemblages that have historically not interacted. Species interactions
   play a central role in the response of ecosystems to climate change, but
   the role of trophic interactions in facilitating or preventing range
   expansions is largely unknown. The goal of our study was to understand
   how predators influence the ability of range-shifting prey to
   successfully establish in newly available habitat following climate
   warming. We hypothesized that fish predation facilitates the
   establishment of colonizing zooplankton populations, because fish
   preferentially consume larger species that would otherwise competitively
   exclude smaller-bodied colonists. We conducted a mesocosm experiment
   with zooplankton communities and their fish predators from lakes of the
   Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, USA. We tested the effect of fish
   predation on the establishment and persistence of a zooplankton
   community when introduced in the presence of higher- and lower-elevation
   communities at two experimental temperatures in field mesocosms. We
   found that predators reduce the abundance of larger-bodied residents
   from the alpine and facilitate the establishment of new lower-elevation
   species. In addition, fish predation and warming independently reduced
   the average body size of zooplankton by up to 30\%. This reduction in
   body size offset the direct effect of warming-induced increases in
   population growth rates, leading to no net change in zooplankton biomass
   or trophic cascade strength. We found support for a shift to smaller
   species with climate change through two mechanisms: (a) the direct
   effects of warming on developmental rates and (b) size-selective
   predation that altered the identity of species' that could colonize new
   higher elevation habitat. Our results suggest that predators can amplify
   the rate of range shifts by consuming larger-bodied residents and
   facilitating the establishment of new species. However, the effects of
   climate warming were dampened by reducing the average body size of
   community members, leading to no net change in ecosystem function,
   despite higher growth rates. This work suggests that trophic
   interactions play a role in the reorganization of regional communities
   under climate warming.},

Abstract = {Recent findings indicate that fishes from lakes in partially burned
   catchments contain greater mercury (Hg) concentrations than fishes from
   reference catchments. increased methyl Hg (MeHg) concentrations in
   fishes can result in serious health problems for consumers. Here we show
   that a forest fire caused a 5-fold increase in whole-body Hg
   accumulation by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and smaller Hg
   increases in muscle of several fish species in a mountain lake. The
   enhanced Hg accumulation was caused primarily by increased nutrient
   concentrations in the lake, which enhanced productivity and restructured
   the food web through increased piscivory and consumption of Mysis. This
   restructuring resulted in increases to the trophic positions and Hg
   concentrations of fishes. Forest fire also caused a large short-term
   release of total Hg (THg) and MeHg to streams and the lake. This release
   initiated a small pulse of MeHg in invertebrates that contributed to
   enhanced Hg accumulation by fishes. Climate change and prescribed
   burning to compensate for past fire suppression are predicted to
   increase future forest fire occurrence in North America, and increased
   Hg accumulation by fishes may be an unexpected consequence.},

Volume = {27},

Pages = {1431-1442},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Copepods are among the most abundant marine metazoans and form a key
   link between marine primary producers, higher trophic levels, and carbon
   sequestration pathways. Climate change is projected to change surface
   ocean temperature by up to 4 degrees C in the North Atlantic with many
   associated changes including slowing of the overturning circulation,
   areas of regional freshening, and increased salinity and reductions in
   nutrients available in the euphotic zone over the next century. These
   changes will lead to a restructuring of phytoplankton and zooplankton
   communities with cascading effects throughout the food web. Here we
   employ observations of copepods, projected changes in ocean climate, and
   species distribution models to show how climate change may affect the
   distribution of copepod species in the North Atlantic. On average
   species move northeast at a rate of 14.1 km decade(-1). Species turnover
   in copepod communities will range from 5\% to 75\% with the highest
   turnover rates concentrated in regions of pronounced temperature
   increase and decrease. The changes in species range vary according to
   copepod traits with the largest effects found to occur in the cooling,
   freshening area in the subpolar North Atlantic south of Greenland and in
   an area of significant warming along the Scotian shelf. Large diapausing
   copepods (>2.5 mm) which are higher in lipids and a crucial food source
   for whales, may have an advantage in the cooling waters due to their
   life-history strategy that facilitates their survival in the arctic
   environment. Carnivorous copepods show a basin wide increase in species
   richness and show significant habitat area increases when their
   distribution moves poleward while herbivores see significant habitat
   area losses. The trait-specific effects highlight the complex
   consequences of climate change for the marine food web.},

Title = {Major restructuring of marine plankton assemblages under global warming},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Marine phytoplankton and zooplankton form the basis of the ocean's
   food-web, yet the impacts of climate change on their biodiversity are
   poorly understood. Here, we use an ensemble of species distribution
   models for a total of 336 phytoplankton and 524 zooplankton species to
   determine their present and future habitat suitability patterns. For the
   end of this century, under a high emission scenario, we find an overall
   increase in plankton species richness driven by ocean warming, and a
   poleward shift of the species' distributions at a median speed of 35
   km/decade. Phytoplankton species richness is projected to increase by
   more than 16\% over most regions except for the Arctic Ocean. In
   contrast, zooplankton richness is projected to slightly decline in the
   tropics, but to increase strongly in temperate to subpolar latitudes. In
   these latitudes, nearly 40\% of the phytoplankton and zooplankton
   assemblages are replaced by poleward shifting species. This implies that
   climate change threatens the contribution of plankton communities to
   plankton-mediated ecosystem services such as biological carbon
   sequestration.
   Warming will affect marine plankton biomass, but also its diversity and
   community composition in poorly understood ways. Here, the authors model
   the spatial distribution of 860 marine plankton species from 10
   functional groups and identify the future hotspots of climate change
   impacts under RCP8.5.},

Title = {Predicting future coexistence in a North American ant community},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1804-1819},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Global climate change will remodel ecological communities worldwide.
   However, as a consequence of biotic interactions, communities may
   respond to climate change in idiosyncratic ways. This makes predictive
   models that incorporate biotic interactions necessary. We show how such
   models can be constructed based on empirical studies in combination with
   predictions or assumptions regarding the abiotic consequences of climate
   change. Specifically, we consider a well-studied ant community in North
   America. First, we use historical data to parameterize a basic model for
   species coexistence. Using this model, we determine the importance of
   various factors, including thermal niches, food discovery rates, and
   food removal rates, to historical species coexistence. We then extend
   the model to predict how the community will restructure in response to
   several climate-related changes, such as increased temperature, shifts
   in species phenology, and altered resource availability. Interestingly,
   our mechanistic model suggests that increased temperature and shifts in
   species phenology can have contrasting effects. Nevertheless, for almost
   all scenarios considered, we find that the most subordinate ant species
   suffers most as a result of climate change. More generally, our analysis
   shows that community composition can respond to climate warming in
   nonintuitive ways. For example, in the context of a community, it is not
   necessarily the most heat-sensitive species that are most at risk. Our
   results demonstrate how models that account for niche partitioning and
   interspecific trade-offs among species can be used to predict the likely
   idiosyncratic responses of local communities to climate change.},

Abstract = {A number of studies indicate that tropical arthropods should be
   particularly vulnerable to climate warming. If these predictions are
   realized, climate warming may have a more profound impact on the
   functioning and diversity of tropical forests than currently
   anticipated. Although arthropods comprise over two-thirds of terrestrial
   species, information on their abundance and extinction rates in tropical
   habitats is severely limited. Here we analyze data on arthropod and
   insectivore abundances taken between 1976 and 2012 at two midelevation
   habitats in Puerto Rico's Luquillo rainforest. During this time, mean
   maximum temperatures have risen by 2.0 degrees C. Using the same study
   area and methods employed by Lister in the 1970s, we discovered that the
   dry weight biomass of arthropods captured in sweep samples had declined
   4 to 8 times, and 30 to 60 times in sticky traps. Analysis of long-term
   data on canopy arthropods and walking sticks taken as part of the
   Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research program revealed sustained
   declines in abundance over two decades, as well as negative regressions
   of abundance on mean maximum temperatures. We also document parallel
   decreases in Luquillo's insectivorous lizards, frogs, and birds. While
   El Nino/Southern Oscillation influences the abundance of forest
   arthropods, climate warming is the major driver of reductions in
   arthropod abundance, indirectly precipitating a bottom-up trophic
   cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web.},

Title = {Experimental heatwaves facilitate invasion and alter species
   interactions and composition in a tropical host-parasitoid community},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 21},
Abstract = {As mean temperatures increase and heatwaves become more frequent,
   species are expanding their distributions to colonise new habitats. The
   resulting novel species interactions will simultaneously shape the
   temperature-driven reorganization of resident communities. The
   interactive effects of climate change and climate change-facilitated
   invasion have rarely been studied in multi-trophic communities, and are
   likely to differ depending on the nature of the climatic driver (i.e.,
   climate extremes or constant warming). We re-created under laboratory
   conditions a host-parasitoid community typical of high-elevation
   rainforest sites in Queensland, Australia, comprising four Drosophila
   species and two associated parasitoid species. We subjected these
   communities to an equivalent increase in average temperature in the form
   of periodic heatwaves or constant warming, in combination with an
   invasion treatment involving a novel host species from lower-elevation
   habitats. The two parasitoid species were sensitive to both warming and
   heatwaves, while the demographic responses of Drosophila species were
   highly idiosyncratic, reflecting the combined effects of thermal
   tolerance, parasitism, competition, and facilitation. After multiple
   generations, our heatwave treatment promoted the establishment of
   low-elevation species in upland communities. Invasion of the
   low-elevation species correlated negatively with the abundance of one of
   the parasitoid species, leading to cascading effects on its hosts and
   their competitors. Our study, therefore, reveals differing, sometimes
   contrasting, impacts of extreme temperatures and constant warming on
   community composition. It also highlights how the scale and direction of
   climate impacts could be further modified by invading species within a
   bi-trophic community network.},

Title = {Climate-driven substitution of foundation species causes breakdown of a
   facilitation cascade with potential implications for higher trophic
   levels},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {110},
Number = {9},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change can alter ecological communities both directly, by
   driving shifts in species distributions and abundances, and indirectly
   by influencing the strength and direction of species interactions.
   Within benthic marine ecosystems, foundation species such as
   canopy-forming macro-algae often underpin important cascades of
   facilitative interactions. We examined the wider impacts of
   climate-driven shifts in the relative abundances of foundation species
   within a temperate reef system, with particular focus on a habitat
   cascade whereby kelp facilitate epiphytic algae that, in turn,
   facilitate mobile invertebrates. Specifically, we tested whether the
   warm-water kelp Laminaria ochroleuca, which has proliferated in response
   to recent warming trends, facilitated a secondary habitat-former
   (epiphytic algae on stipes) and associated mobile invertebrates, to the
   same degree as the cold-water kelp Laminaria hyperborea. The
   facilitative interaction between kelp and stipe-associated epiphytic
   algae was dramatically weaker for the warm-water foundation species,
   leading to breakdown of a habitat cascade and impoverished associated
   faunal assemblages. On average, the warm-water kelp supported >250 times
   less epiphytic algae (by biomass) and >50 times fewer mobile
   invertebrates (by abundance) than the cold-water kelp. Moreover, by
   comparing regions of pre- and post-range expansion by L. ochroleuca, we
   found that warming-impacted kelp forests supported around half the
   biomass of epiphytic algae and one-fifth of the abundance of mobile
   invertebrates, per unit area, compared with unimpacted forests. We
   suggest that disruption to this facilitation cascade has the potential
   to impact upon higher trophic levels, specifically kelp forest fishes,
   through lower prey availability. Synthesis. Climate-driven shifts in
   species' distributions and the relative abundances of foundation
   organisms will restructure communities and alter ecological
   interactions, with consequences for ecosystem functioning. We show that
   climate-driven substitutions of seemingly similar foundation species can
   alter local biodiversity and trophic processes in temperate marine
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Facilitation among plants in alpine environments in the face of climate
   change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {While there is a large consensus that plantplant interactions are a
   crucial component of the response of plant communities to the effects of
   climate change, available data remain scarce, particularly in alpine
   systems. This represents an important obstacle to making consistent
   predictions about the future of plant communities. Here, we review
   current knowledge on the effects of climate change on facilitation among
   alpine plant communities and propose directions for future research. In
   established alpine communities, while warming seemingly generates a net
   facilitation release, earlier snowmelt may increase facilitation. Some
   nurse plants are able to buffer microenvironmental changes in the long
   term and may ensure the persistence of other alpine plants through local
   migration events. For communities migrating to higher elevations,
   facilitation should play an important role in their reorganization
   because of the harsher environmental conditions. In particular, the
   absence of efficient nurse plants might slow down upward migration,
   possibly generating chains of extinction. Facilitationclimate change
   relationships are expected to shift along latitudinal gradients because
   (1) the magnitude of warming is predicted to vary along these gradients,
   and (2) alpine environments are significantly different at low vs. high
   latitudes. Data on these expected patterns are preliminary and thus need
   to be tested with further studies on facilitation among plants in alpine
   environments that have thus far not been considered. From a
   methodological standpoint, future studies will benefit from the spatial
   representation of the microclimatic environment of plants to predict
   their response to climate change. Moreover, the acquisition of long-term
   data on the dynamics of plantplant interactions, either through
   permanent plots or chronosequences of glacial recession, may represent
   powerful approaches to clarify the relationship between plant
   interactions and climate change.},

Abstract = {Insects are among the most diverse and widespread animals across the
   biosphere and are well-known for their contributions to ecosystem
   functioning and services. Recent increases in the frequency and
   magnitude of climatic extremes (CE), in particular temperature extremes
   (TE) owing to anthropogenic climate change, are exposing insect
   populations and communities to unprecedented stresses. However, a major
   problem in understanding insect responses to TE is that they are still
   highly unpredictable both spatially and temporally, which reduces
   frequency- or direction-dependent selective responses by insects.
   Moreover, how species interactions and community structure may change in
   response to stresses imposed by TE is still poorly understood. Here we
   provide an overview of how terrestrial insects respond to TE by
   integrating their organismal physiology, multitrophic, and
   community-level interactions, and building that up to explore scenarios
   for population explosions and crashes that have ecosystem-level
   consequences. We argue that TE can push insect herbivores and their
   natural enemies to and even beyond their adaptive limits, which may
   differ among species intimately involved in trophic interactions,
   leading to phenological disruptions and the structural reorganization of
   food webs. TE may ultimately lead to outbreak-breakdown cycles in insect
   communities with detrimental consequences for ecosystem functioning and
   resilience. Lastly, we suggest new research lines that will help achieve
   a better understanding of insect and community responses to a wide range
   of CE.},

Title = {In situ warming strengthens trophic cascades in a coastal food web},
Journal = {OIKOS},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Global warming may affect most organisms and their interactions. Theory
   and simple mesocosm experiments suggest that consumer top-down control
   over primary producer biomass should strengthen with warming, since
   consumer respiration increases faster with warming than plant
   photosynthesis. However, these predictions have so far not been tested
   on natural communities that have experienced warming over many
   generations. Natural systems display a higher diversity, heterogeneity
   and complexity than mesocosms, which could alter predicted effects of
   warming. Here we used an artificially heated part of the northern Baltic
   Sea (the Forsmark Biotest basin) to test how warming influences trophic
   interactions in a shallow coastal food web with four trophic levels:
   omnivorous fish, invertivorous fish, herbivorous invertebrates, and
   filamentous macroalgae. Monitoring of fish assemblages over six years
   showed that small invertivorous fish (gobiids, sticklebacks and minnows)
   were much less abundant in the heated basin than in unheated references
   areas. Stomach content analyses of the dominating omnivorous fish -
   Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis - revealed a strikingly different diet
   within and outside the Biotest basin; gammarid crustaceans were the
   dominating prey at heated sites, whereas invertivorous fish (e.g.
   gobiids) dominated at unheated sites. A 45-day cage experiment showed
   that fish exclusion did not affect the biomass of algal herbivores
   (gastropods and gammarids), but reduced algal biomass in heated sites
   (but not unheated). This suggests that warming induced a trophic cascade
   from fish to algae, and that this effect was mediated by
   predator-induced changes in herbivore behavior, rather than number.
   Overall, our study suggests that warming has effectively compressed the
   food chain from four to three trophic levels (algae, gammarids and
   perch), which have benefitted the primary producers by reducing grazing
   pressure. Consequently, warming appears to have restructured this
   coastal food web through a combination of direct (physiological) and
   indirect (species interactions) effects.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Driven by climate change, marine biodiversity is undergoing a phase of
   rapid change that has proven to be even faster than changes observed in
   terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding how these changes in species
   composition will affect future marine life is crucial for conservation
   management, especially due to increasing demands for marine natural
   resources. Here, we analyse predictions of a multiparameter habitat
   suitability model covering the global projected ranges of > 33,500
   marine species from climate model projections under three CO2 emission
   scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) up to the year 2100. Our results show
   that the core habitat area will decline for many species, resulting in a
   net loss of 50\% of the core habitat area for almost half of all marine
   species in 2100 under the high-emission scenario RCP8.5. As an
   additional consequence of the continuing distributional reorganization
   of marine life, gaps around the equator will appear for 8\% (RCP2.6),
   24\% (RCP4.5), and 88\% (RCP8.5) of marine species with cross-equatorial
   ranges. For many more species, continuous distributional ranges will be
   disrupted, thus reducing effective population size. In addition, high
   invasion rates in higher latitudes and polar regions will lead to
   substantial changes in the ecosystem and food web structure,
   particularly regarding the introduction of new predators. Overall, our
   study highlights that the degree of spatial and structural
   reorganization of marine life with ensued consequences for ecosystem
   functionality and conservation efforts will critically depend on the
   realized greenhouse gas emission pathway.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {The response of marine plankton to climate change is of critical
   importance to the oceanic food web and fish stocks. We use a 60-year
   ocean basin-wide data set comprising > 4148,000 samples to reveal huge
   differences in range changes associated with climate change across 35
   plankton taxa. While the range of dinoflagellates and copepods tended to
   closely track the velocity of climate change (the rate of isotherm
   movement), the range of the diatoms moved much more slowly. Differences
   in range shifts were up to 900 km in a recent warming period, with
   average velocities of range movement between 7 km per decade northwards
   for taxa exhibiting niche plasticity and 99 km per decade for taxa
   exhibiting niche conservatism. The differing responses of taxa to global
   warming will cause spatial restructuring of the plankton ecosystem with
   likely consequences for grazing pressures on phytoplankton and hence for
   biogeochemical cycling, higher trophic levels and biodiversity.},

Title = {Ocean community warming responses explained by thermal affinities and
   temperature gradients},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Pages = {959+},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As ocean temperatures rise, species distributions are tracking towards
   historically cooler regions in line with their thermal affinity(1,2).
   However, different responses of species to warming and changed species
   interactions make predicting biodiversity redistribution and relative
   abundance a challenge(3,4). Here, we use three decades of fish and
   plankton survey data to assess how warming changes the relative
   dominance of warm-affinity and cold-affinity species(5,6). Regions with
   stable temperatures (for example, the Northeast Pacific and Gulf of
   Mexico) show little change in dominance structure, while areas with
   warming (for example, the North Atlantic) see strong shifts towards
   warm-water species dominance. Importantly, communities whose species
   pools had diverse thermal affinities and a narrower range of thermal
   tolerance showed greater sensitivity, as anticipated from simulations.
   The composition of fish communities changed less than expected in
   regions with strong temperature depth gradients. There, species track
   temperatures by moving deeper(2,7), rather than horizontally, analogous
   to elevation shifts in land plants(8). Temperature thus emerges as a
   fundamental driver for change in marine systems, with predictable
   restructuring of communities in the most rapidly warming areas using
   metrics based on species thermal affinities. The ready and predictable
   dominance shifts suggest a strong prognosis of resilience to climate
   change for these communities.},

Title = {Ensemble Projections of Future Climate Change Impacts on the Eastern
   Bering Sea Food Web Using a Multispecies Size Spectrum Model},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Characterization of uncertainty (variance) in ecosystem projections
   under climate change is still rare despite its importance for informing
   decision-making and prioritizing research. We developed an ensemble
   modeling framework to evaluate the relative importance of different
   uncertainty sources for food web projections of the eastern Bering Sea
   (EBS). Specifically, dynamically downscaled projections from Earth
   System Models (ESM) under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios
   (GHG) were used to force a multispecies size spectrum model (MSSM) of
   the EBS food web. In addition to ESM and GHG uncertainty, we
   incorporated uncertainty from different plausible fisheries management
   scenarios reflecting shifts in the total allowable catch of flatfish and
   gadids and different assumptions regarding temperature-dependencies on
   biological rates in the MSSM. Relative to historical averages
   (1994-2014), end-of-century (2080-2100 average) ensemble projections of
   community spawner stock biomass, catches, and mean body size (+/-
   standard deviation) decreased by 36\% (+/- 21\%), 61\% (+/- 27\%), and
   38\% (+/- 25\%), respectively. Long-term trends were, on average, also
   negative for the majority of species, but the level of trend consistency
   between ensemble projections was low for most species. Projection
   uncertainty for model outputs from -2020 to 2040 was driven by
   inter-annual climate variability for 85\% of species and the community
   as a whole. Thereafter, structural uncertainty (different ESMs,
   temperature-dependency assumptions) dominated projection uncertainty.
   Fishery management and GHG emissions scenarios contributed little
   (<10\%) to projection uncertainty, with the exception of catches for a
   subset of flatfishes which were dominated by fishery management
   scenarios. Long-term outcomes were improved in most cases under a
   moderate ``mitigation{''} relative to a high ``business-as-usual{''} GHG
   emissions scenario and we show how inclusion of temperature-dependencies
   on processes related to body growth and intrinsic (non-predation)
   natural mortality can strongly influence projections in potentially
   non-additive ways. Narrowing the spread of long-term projections in
   future ensemble simulations will depend primarily on whether the set of
   ESMs and food web models considered behave more or less similarly to one
   another relative to the present models sets. Further model skill
   assessment and data integration are needed to aid in the reduction and
   quantification of uncertainties if we are to advance predictive ecology.},

Abstract = {Great Slave Lake (GSL), one of the world's largest and deepest lakes,
   has undergone an aquatic ecosystem transformation in response to
   twenty-first-century accelerated Arctic warming that is unparalleled in
   at least the past two centuries. Algal remains from four high-resolution
   palaeolimnological records retrieved from the West Basin provide
   baseline limnological data that we compared with historical phycological
   surveys undertaken on GSL between the 1940s and 1990s. We document the
   rapid restructuring of algal community composition ca 2000 CE that is
   consistent with recent increases in regional air temperature and
   declines in ice cover and wind speed, that collectively altered habitats
   for aquatic biota. This new limnological regime initiated the first
   observation of scaled chrysophytes and favoured the rapid proliferation
   of small planktonic cyclotelloid diatoms which replaced the
   long-established dominance of large filamentous Aulacoseira islandica in
   West Basin sedimentary records. Such abrupt transformations in the
   primary producers of this socioecologically valuable `northern Great
   Lake' may have widespread implications for the entire food web with
   unknown consequences for aquatic ecosystem functioning and fisheries,
   which First Nations, Metis and other northern communities depend upon,
   pointing to the need for new studies.},

   change},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Ongoing climate change is predicted to trigger major shifts in the
   geographic distribution of marine plankton species. However, it remains
   unclear whether species will successfully track optimal habitats to new
   regions, or face extinction. Here we show that one significant
   zoo-plankton group, the radiolaria, underwent a severe decline in high
   latitude species richness presaged by ecologic reorganization during the
   late Neogene, a time of amplified polar cooling. We find that the
   majority (71\%) of affected species did not relocate to the warmer low
   latitudes, but went extinct. This indicates that some plankton species
   cannot track optimal temperatures on a global scale as assumed by
   ecologic models; instead, assemblages undergo restructuring and
   extinction once local environmental thresholds are exceeded. This
   pattern forewarns profound diversity loss of high latitude radiolaria in
   the near future, which may have cascading effects on the ocean food web
   and carbon cycle.},

Title = {Thermal affinity as the dominant factor changing Mediterranean fish
   abundances},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {E80-E89},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent decades have seen profound changes in species abundance and
   community composition. In the marine environment, the major
   anthropogenic drivers of change comprise exploitation, invasion by
   nonindigenous species, and climate change. However, the magnitude of
   these stressors has been widely debated and we lack empirical estimates
   of their relative importance. In this study, we focused on Eastern
   Mediterranean, a region exposed to an invasion of species of Red Sea
   origin, extreme climate change, and high fishing pressure. We estimated
   changes in fish abundance using two fish trawl surveys spanning a
   20-year period, and correlated these changes with estimated sensitivity
   of species to the different stressors. We estimated sensitivity to
   invasion using the trait similarity between indigenous and nonindigenous
   species; sensitivity to fishing using a published composite index based
   on the species' life-history; and sensitivity to climate change using
   species climatic affinity based on occurrence data. Using both a
   meta-analytical method and random forest analysis, we found that for
   shallow-water species the most important driver of population size
   changes is sensitivity to climate change. Species with an affinity to
   warm climates increased in relative abundance and species with an
   affinity to cold climates decreased suggesting a strong response to
   warming local sea temperatures over recent decades. This decrease in the
   abundance of cold-water-associated species at the trailing ``warm{''}
   end of their distribution has been rarely documented. Despite the
   immense biomass of nonindigenous species and the presumed high fishing
   pressure, these two latter factors seem to have only a minor role in
   explaining abundance changes. The decline in abundance of indigenous
   species of cold-water origin indicates a future major restructuring of
   fish communities in the Mediterranean in response to the ongoing
   warming, with unknown impacts on ecosystem function.},

Title = {Lake diatom responses to warming: reviewing the evidence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-35},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Algae, the dominant primary producers in many aquatic ecosystems, are
   critical to global biogeochemical cycling, and changes in their
   abundance and composition can cascade throughout aquatic food webs.
   Diatoms often dominate the algal communities in many freshwater systems.
   Their population dynamics are affected by a variety of environmental
   variables, many of which are linked to changes in water column
   properties and habitat availability, which themselves can be linked to
   shifts in ice cover, length of the growing season, thermal stability and
   stratification, vertical mixing patterns, habitat alterations, and the
   availability of resources such as light and nutrients. Climate has
   strong moderating controls on all of these fundamental aquatic
   processes, which can directly and indirectly alter species composition,
   abundance and seasonal dynamics of both periphytic and planktonic
   diatoms. In this review, we examine the role that climate-mediated
   alterations in inter-related lake processes have played on diatom
   community composition, dynamics and size structure, with particular
   attention to the recent success of planktonic diatom species relative to
   heavier tychoplanktonic and small benthic diatoms. We focus primarily on
   paleolimnological records, but also reference a wide spectrum of
   limnological and physiological studies to review and discuss how
   climate-driven shifts in lake properties may affect diatom assemblage
   reorganization. Understanding the limnological and historical context of
   these often complex diatom changes is key to making scientifically
   defensible interpretations of paleolimnological records. We further
   evaluate the plausibility of alternative explanations (e.g. atmospheric
   nitrogen deposition) for the recent success of small cyclotelloid
   species by examining trends in these planktonic diatoms from a large
   number of sites. Using a weight-of-evidence approach, we conclude that
   recent climate change is the main driver that has led to ecological
   tipping points resulting in the recent success of small planktonic
   diatoms that have been reported in many aquatic systems.},

Abstract = {Organism size is one of the key determinants of community structure, and
   its relationship with abundance can describe how biomass is partitioned
   among the biota within an ecosystem. An outdoor freshwater mesocosm
   experiment was used to determine how warming of similar to 4 degrees C
   would affect the size, biomass and taxonomic structure of planktonic
   communities. Warming increased the steepness of the community size
   spectrum by increasing the prevalence of small organisms, primarily
   within the phytoplankton assemblage and it also reduced the mean and
   maximum size of phytoplankton by approximately one order of magnitude.
   The observed shifts in phytoplankton size structure were reflected in
   changes in phytoplankton community composition, though zooplankton
   taxonomic composition was unaffected by warming. Furthermore, warming
   reduced community biomass and total phytoplankton biomass, although
   zooplankton biomass was unaffected. This resulted in an increase in the
   zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the warmed mesocosms,
   which could be explained by faster turnover within the phytoplankton
   assemblages. Overall, warming shifted the distribution of phytoplankton
   size towards smaller individuals with rapid turnover and low standing
   biomass, resulting in a reorganization of the biomass structure of the
   food webs. These results indicate future environmental warming may have
   profound effects on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities
   and ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Natural history studies documenting spatial and temporal variation of
   species assemblages and their interactions are critical for
   understanding biodiversity and community ecology. We characterized
   caterpillar-parasitoid assemblages on shrubs in the genus Piper across
   remnants of semi-evergreen forest in the Yucatan Peninsula during the
   rainy and rainy-dry seasons. We collected caterpillars feeding on Piper
   leaves and reared them to adults or parasitoids to: (i) describe
   tritrophic interactions between Piper, caterpillars, and parasitoids,
   (ii) compare empirical metanetworks among sites and seasons, and (iii)
   investigate patterns in species and interaction turnover across spatial
   and temporal scales to understand the contribution of species
   composition and interaction rewiring to overall interaction turnover. We
   found six Piper species supporting 79 species of caterpillars, which in
   turn hosted 20 species of parasitoids. In total, there were 116 realized
   trophic interactions. Species and interactions exhibited substantial
   turnover at temporal and spatial scales. Total interaction turnover was
   more pronounced across seasons in all sites (>93\%), than it was between
   sites (<91\%). We also found that interaction rewiring contributed more
   to overall interaction turnover than species turnover. The spatial and
   temporal variation in metanetworks documented here contribute to
   understanding fine-scale temporal and spatial turnover in tropical
   species and interactions and raise important questions about the
   lability of consumer specialization and the short-term effects of
   interaction rewiring on the stability of biotic communities. Our results
   highlight the importance of tropical food web studies that are based on
   natural history using consistent field methods to document bi- and
   tripartite interactions.

Title = {A cascade of warming impacts brings bluefin tuna to Greenland waters},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2484-2491},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Rising ocean temperatures are causing marine fish species to shift
   spatial distributions and ranges, and are altering predator-prey
   dynamics in food webs. Most documented cases of species shifts so far
   involve relatively small species at lower trophic levels, and consider
   individual species in ecological isolation from others. Here, we show
   that a large highly migratory top predator fish species has entered a
   high latitude subpolar area beyond its usual range. Bluefin tuna,
   Thunnus thynnus Linnaeus 1758, were captured in waters east of Greenland
   (65 degrees N) in August 2012 during exploratory fishing for Atlantic
   mackerel, Scomber scombrus Linnaeus 1758. The bluefin tuna were captured
   in a single net-haul in 9-11 degrees C water together with 6 tonnes of
   mackerel, which is a preferred prey species and itself a new immigrant
   to the area. Regional temperatures in August 2012 were historically high
   and contributed to a warming trend since 1985, when temperatures began
   to rise. The presence of bluefin tuna in this region is likely due to a
   combination of warm temperatures that are physiologically more tolerable
   and immigration of an important prey species to the region. We conclude
   that a cascade of climate change impacts is restructuring the food web
   in east Greenland waters.},

Title = {Drifting Phenologies Cause Reduced Seasonality of Butterflies in
   Response to Increasing Temperatures},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change has caused many ecological changes around the world.
   Altered phenology is among the most commonly observed effects of climate
   change, and the list of species interactions affected by altered
   phenology is growing. Although many studies on altered phenology focus
   on single species or on pairwise species interactions, most ecological
   communities are comprised of numerous, ecologically similar species
   within trophic groups. Using a 12-year butterfly monitoring citizen
   science data set, we aimed to assess the degree to which butterfly
   communities may be changing over time. Specifically, we wanted to assess
   the degree to which phenological sensitivities to temperature could
   affect temporal overlap among species within communities, independent of
   changes in abundance, species richness, and evenness. We found that
   warming winter temperatures may be associated with some butterfly
   species making use of the coldest months of the year to fly as adults,
   thus changing temporal co-occurrence with other butterfly species. Our
   results suggest that changing temperatures could cause immediate
   restructuring of communities without requiring changes in overall
   abundance or diversity. Such changes could have fitness consequences for
   individuals within trophic levels by altering competition for resources,
   as well as indirect effects mediated by species interactions across
   trophic levels.},

Title = {Warming of Subarctic waters accelerates development of a key marine
   zooplankton <i>Calanus finmarchicus</i>},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {172-183},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent observations confirm the rising temperatures of Atlantic waters
   transported into the Arctic Ocean via the West Spitsbergen Current
   (WSC). We studied the overall abundance and population structure of the
   North Atlantic keystone zoo-plankton copepod Calanus finmarchicus, which
   is the main prey for pelagic fish and some seabirds, in relation to
   selected environmental variables in this area between 2001 and 2011,
   when warming in the Arctic and Subarctic was particularly pronounced.
   Sampling within a 3-week time window each summer demonstrated that
   trends in the overall abundance of C. finmarchicus varied between years,
   with the highest values in ``extreme{''} years, due to high numbers of
   nauplii and early cope-podite stages in colder years (2001, 2004, 2010),
   and contrary to that, the fifth copepodite stage (C5) peaking in warm
   years (2006, 2007, 2009). The most influential environmental variable
   driving C. finmarchicus life cycle was temperature, which promoted an
   increased C5 abundance when the temperature was above 6 degrees C,
   indicating earlier spawning and/or accelerated development, and possibly
   leading to their development to adults later in the summer and spawning
   for the second time, given adequate food supply. Based on the presented
   high interannual and spatial variability, we hypothesize that under a
   warmer climate, C. finmarchicus may annually produce two generations in
   the southern part of the WSC, what in turn could lead to food web
   reorganization of important top predators, such as little auks, and
   induce northward migrations of fish, especially the Norwegian herring.},

Title = {Connected macroalgal-sediment systems: blue carbon and food webs in the
   deep coastal ocean},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {89},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Macroalgae drive the largest CO2 flux fixed globally by marine
   macrophytes. Most of the resulting biomass is exported through the
   coastal ocean as detritus and yet almost no field measurements have
   verified its potential net sequestration in marine sediments. This gap
   limits the scope for the inclusion of macroalgae within blue carbon
   schemes that support ocean carbon sequestration globally, and the
   understanding of the role their carbon plays within distal food webs.
   Here, we pursued three lines of evidence (eDNA sequencing, Bayesian
   Stable Isotope Mixing Modeling, and benthic-pelagic process
   measurements) to generate needed, novel data addressing this gap. To
   this end, a 13-month study was undertaken at a deep coastal sedimentary
   site in the English Channel, and the surrounding shoreline of Plymouth,
   UK. The eDNA sequencing indicated that detritus from most macroalgae in
   surrounding shores occurs within deep, coastal sediments, with detritus
   supply reflecting the seasonal ecology of individual species. Bayesian
   stable isotope mixing modeling {[}C and N] highlighted its vital role in
   supporting the deep coastal benthic food web (22-36\% of diets),
   especially when other resources are seasonally low. The magnitude of
   detritus uptake within the food web and sediments varies seasonally,
   with an average net sedimentary organic macroalgal carbon sequestration
   of 8.75 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1). The average net
   sequestration of particulate organic carbon in sediments is 58.74 g C
   center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), the two rates corresponding to 4-5\%
   and 26-37\% of those associated with mangroves, salt marshes, and
   seagrass beds, systems more readily identified as blue carbon habitats.
   These novel data provide important first estimates that help to
   contextualize the importance of macroalgal-sedimentary connectivity for
   deep coastal food webs, and measured fluxes help constrain its role
   within global blue carbon that can support policy development. At a time
   when climate change mitigation is at the foreground of environmental
   policy development, embracing the full potential of the ocean in
   supporting climate regulation via CO2 sequestration is a necessity.},

Abstract = {Changes in climate, land use, fire incidence, and ecological connections
   all may contribute to current species' range shifts. Species shift range
   individually, and not all species shift range at the same time and rate.
   This variation causes community reorganization in both the old and new
   ranges. In terrestrial ecosystems, range shifts alter
   aboveground-belowground interactions, influencing species abundance,
   community composition, ecosystem processes and services, and feedbacks
   within communities and ecosystems. Thus, range shifts may result in
   no-analog communities where foundation species and community genetics
   play unprecedented roles, possibly leading to novel ecosystems.
   Long-distance dispersal can enhance the disruption of
   aboveground-belowground interactions of plants, herbivores, pathogens,
   symbiotic mutualists, and decomposer organisms. These effects are most
   likely stronger for latitudinal than for altitudinal range shifts.
   Disrupted aboveground-belowground interactions may have influenced
   historical postglacial range shifts as well. Assisted migration without
   considering aboveground-belowground interactions could enhance risks of
   such range shift-induced invasions.},

Abstract = {The assessment of climate impact on marine communities dwelling deeper
   than the well-studied shelf seas has been hampered by the lack of
   long-term data. For a long time, the prevailing expectation has been
   that thermal stability in deep ocean layers will delay ecosystem
   responses to warming. Few observational studies have challenged this
   view and indicated that deep organisms can respond exceptionally fast to
   physical change at the sea surface. To address the depth-specific impact
   of climate change, we investigated spatio-temporal changes in fish
   community structure along a bathymetry gradient of 150-1500 m between
   1998 and 2016 in East Greenland. Here, the Arctic East Greenland Current
   and the Atlantic Irminger Current meet and mix, representing a
   sub-Arctic transition zone. We found the strongest signals of community
   reorganizations at depths between 350 and 1000 m and only weak responses
   in the shallowest and deepest regions. Changes were in synchrony with
   atmospheric warming, loss in sea ice and variability in physical sea
   surface conditions both within our study region and North of the Denmark
   Strait. These results suggest that interannual variability and long-term
   climate trends of the larger ecoregion can rapidly affect fish
   communities down to 1000-m depth through atmospheric ocean coupling and
   food web interactions.},

Abstract = {Negative interactions among species are a major force shaping natural
   communities and are predicted to strengthen as climate change
   intensifies. Similarly, positive interactions are anticipated to
   intensify and could buffer the consequences of climate-driven
   disturbances. We used in situ experiments at volcanic CO2 vents within a
   temperate rocky reef to show that ocean acidification can drive
   community reorganization through indirect and direct positive pathways.
   A keystone species, the algal-farming damselfish Parma alboscapularis,
   enhanced primary productivity through its weeding of algae whose
   productivity was also boosted by elevated CO2. The accelerated primary
   productivity was associated with increased densities of primary
   consumers (herbivorous invertebrates), which indirectly supported
   increased secondary consumers densities (predatory fish) (i.e.
   strengthening of bottom-up fuelling). However, this keystone species
   also reduced predatory fish densities through behavioural interference,
   releasing invertebrate prey from predation pressure and enabling a
   further boost in prey densities (i.e. weakening of top-down control). We
   uncover a novel mechanism where a keystone herbivore mediates bottom-up
   and top-down processes simultaneously to boost populations of a
   coexisting herbivore, resulting in altered food web interactions and
   predator populations under future ocean acidification.},

Abstract = {Forest dynamics are driven by top-down changes in climate and bottom-up
   positive (destabilizing) and negative (stabilizing) biophysical
   feedbacks involving disturbance and biotic interactions. When positive
   feedbacks prevail, the resulting self-propagating changes can
   potentially shift the system into a new state, even in the absence of
   climate change. Conversely, negative feedbacks help maintain a dynamic
   equilibrium that allows communities to recover their pre-disturbance
   characteristics. We examine palaeoenvironmental records from temperate
   forests to assess the nature of long-term stability and regime shifts
   under a broader range of environmental forcings than can be observed at
   present. Forest histories from northwestern USA, Patagonia, Tasmania and
   New Zealand show long-term trajectories that were governed by (i) the
   biophysical template, (ii) characteristics of climate and disturbance,
   (iii) historical legacies that condition the ecological capacity to
   respond to subsequent disturbances, and (iv) thresholds that act as
   irreversible barriers. Attention only to current forest conditions
   overlooks the significance of history in creating path dependency, the
   importance of individual extreme events, and the inherent feedbacks that
   force an ecosystem into reorganization. A long-time perspective on
   ecological resilience helps guide conservation strategies that focus on
   environmental preservation as well as identify vulnerable species and
   ecosystems to future climate change. This article is part of the theme
   issue `Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and

Title = {Extreme Levels of Ocean Acidification Restructure the Plankton Community
   and Biogeochemistry of a Temperate Coastal Ecosystem: A Mesocosm Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {The oceans' uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) decreases
   seawater pH and alters the inorganic carbon speciation - summarized in
   the term ocean acidification (OA). Already today, coastal regions
   experience episodic pH events during which surface layer pH drops below
   values projected for the surface ocean at the end of the century. Future
   OA is expected to further enhance the intensity of these coastal extreme
   pH events. To evaluate the influence of such episodic OA events in
   coastal regions, we deployed eight pelagic mesocosms for 53 days in
   Raunefjord, Norway, and enclosed 56-61 m(3) of local seawater containing
   a natural plankton community under nutrient limited post-bloom
   conditions. Four mesocosms were enriched with CO2 to simulate extreme
   pCO2 levels of 1978 - 2069 mu atm while the other four served as
   untreated controls. Here, we present results from multivariate analyses
   on OA-induced changes in the phyto-, micro-, and mesozooplankton
   community structure. Pronounced differences in the plankton community
   emerged early in the experiment, and were amplified by enhanced top-down
   control throughout the study period. The plankton groups responding most
   profoundly to high CO2 conditions were cyanobacteria (negative),
   chlorophyceae (negative), autoand heterotrophic microzooplankton
   (negative), and a variety of mesozooplanktonic taxa, including copepoda
   (mixed), appendicularia (positive), hydrozoa (positive), fish larvae
   (positive), and gastropoda (negative). The restructuring of the
   community coincided with significant changes in the concentration and
   elemental stoichiometry of particulate organic matter. Results imply
   that extreme CO2 events can lead to a substantial reorganization of the
   planktonic food web, affecting multiple trophic levels from
   phytoplankton to primary and secondary consumers.},

Abstract = {Climate warming alters the structure of ecological communities by
   modifying species interactions at different trophic levels. Yet, the
   consequences of warming-led modifications in biotic interactions at
   higher trophic levels on lower trophic groups are lesser known. Here, we
   test the effects of multiple predator species on prey population size
   and traits and subsequent effects on basal resources along an
   experimental temperature gradient (12-15 degrees C, 17-20 degrees C, and
   22-25 degrees C). We experimentally assembled food web modules with two
   congeneric predatory mites (Hypoaspis miles and Hypoaspis aculeifer) and
   two Collembola prey species (Folsomia candida and Proisotoma minuta) on
   a litter and yeast mixture as the basal resources. We hypothesized that
   warming would modify interactions within and between predator species,
   and that these alterations would cascade to basal resources via changes
   in the density and traits (body size and lipid: protein ratio) of the
   prey species. The presence of congeners constrained the growth of the
   predatory species independent of warming despite warming increased
   predator density in their respective monocultures. We found that warming
   effects on both prey and basal resources were greater than the effects
   of predator communities. Our results further showed opposite effects of
   warming on predator (increase) and prey densities (decrease), indicating
   a warming-induced trophic mismatch, which are likely to alter food web
   structures. We highlight that warmer environments can restructure food
   webs by its direct effects on lower trophic groups even without
   modifying top-down effects.},

Abstract = {Model projections indicate that climate change may dramatically
   restructure phytoplankton communities, with cascading consequences for
   marine food webs. It is currently not known whether evolutionary change
   is likely to be able to keep pace with the rate of climate change. For
   simplicity, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, most model
   projections assume species have fixed environmental preferences and will
   not adapt to changing environmental conditions on the century scale.
   Using 15 y of observations from Station CARIACO (Carbon Retention in a
   Colored Ocean), we show that most of the dominant species from a marine
   phytoplankton community were able to adapt their realized niches to
   track average increases in water temperature and irradiance, but the
   majority of species exhibited a fixed niche for nitrate. We do not know
   the extent of this adaptive capacity, so we cannot conclude that
   phytoplankton will be able to adapt to the changes anticipated over the
   next century, but community ecosystem models can no longer assume that
   phytoplankton cannot adapt.},

Abstract = {We present the first evidence of biological change in all of the pelagic
   Laurentian Great Lakes associated with recent climatic warming. We
   hypothesized that measured changes in lake temperature, and the
   resulting physical changes to water columns, were affecting diatom
   communities in the Great Lakes. A paleolimnological analysis of 10
   sediment cores collected from deep locations throughout the Great Lakes
   basin indicates a recent (30-50 yr) reorganization of the diatom
   community to one characterized by elevated abundances of several species
   from the group Cyclotella sensu lato, coinciding with rising atmospheric
   and water temperatures. These Cyclotella increases are a probable
   mechanistic result of new physical regimes such as changing
   stratification depths and longer ice-free periods, and possibly water
   quality shifts. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of these changes
   are ongoing, but this compositional reorganization in primary producers
   could have important implications to Great Lakes food webs.},

Title = {Multiple facets of marine biodiversity in the Pacific Arctic under
   future climate},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {744},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Climate change is triggering a global reorganization of marine life.
   Biogeographical transition zones, diversity-rich regions straddling
   biogeographical units where many species live at, or dose to, their
   physiological tolerance limits (i.e., range distribution edges), are
   redistribution hotspots that offer a unique opportunity to understand
   the mechanisms and consequences of climate-driven thermophilization
   processes in natural communities. In this context, we examined the
   impacts of climate change projections in the 21st century (2026-2100) on
   marine biodiversity in the Eastern Bering and Chukchi seas within the
   Pacific Arctic, a climatically exposed and sensitive boreal-to-Arctic
   transition zone. Overall, projected changes in species distributions,
   modeled using species distribution models, resulted in poleward
   increases in species richness and functional redundancy, along with
   pronounced reductions in phylogenetic distances by century's end
   (2076-2100). Future poleward shifts of boreal species in response to
   warming and sea ice changes are projected to alter the taxonomic and
   functional biogeography of contemporary Arctic communities as larger,
   longer-lived and more predatory taxa expand their leading distributional
   margins. Drawing from the existing evidence from other Arctic regions,
   these changes are anticipated to increase the susceptibility and
   vulnerability of the Arctic ecosystems, as trophic connectance between
   biological components increases, thus decreasing the modularity of
   Arctic food webs. Our results demonstrate how integrating multiple
   diversity facets can provide key insights into the relationships between
   climate change, species composition and ecosystem functioning across
   marine biogeographic regions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The effect of environmental change on ecosystems is mediated by species
   interactions. Environmental change may remove or add species and shift
   life-history events, altering which species interact at a given time.
   However, environmental change may also reconfigure multispecies
   interactions when both species composition and phenology remain intact.
   In a Caribbean island system, a major manifestation of environmental
   change is seaweed deposition, which has been linked to eutrophication,
   overfishing, and hurricanes. Here, we show in a whole-island field
   experiment that without seaweed two predators-lizards and ants-had a
   substantially greater-than-additive effect on herbivory. When seaweed
   was added to mimic deposition by hurricanes, no interactive predator
   effect occurred. Thus environmental change can substantially restructure
   food-web interactions, complicating efforts to predict anthropogenic
   changes in ecosystem processes.},

Abstract = {Recent climate change has triggered profound reorganization in northeast
   Atlantic ecosystems, with substantial impact on the distribution of
   marine assemblages from plankton to fishes. However, assessing the
   repercussions on apex marine predators remains a challenging issue,
   especially for pelagic species. In this study, we use Bayesian
   coalescent modelling of microsatellite variation to track the population
   demographic history of one of the smallest temperate cetaceans, the
   harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in European waters. Combining
   genetic inferences with palaeo-oceanographic and historical records
   provides strong evidence that populations of harbour porpoises have
   responded markedly to the recent climate-driven reorganization in the
   eastern North Atlantic food web. This response includes the isolation of
   porpoises in Iberian waters from those further north only approximately
   300 years ago with a predominant northward migration, contemporaneous
   with the warming trend underway since the `Little Ice Age' period and
   with the ongoing retreat of cold-water fishes from the Bay of Biscay.
   The extinction or exodus of harbour porpoises from the Mediterranean Sea
   (leaving an isolated relict population in the Black Sea) has lacked a
   coherent explanation. The present results suggest that the fragmentation
   of harbour distribution range in the Mediterranean Sea was triggered
   during the warm `Mid-Holocene Optimum' period (approx. 5000 years ago),
   by the end of the post-glacial nutrient-rich `Sapropel' conditions that
   prevailed before that time.},

Abstract = {Global climate change scenarios predict lake water temperatures to
   increase up to 4 degrees C and extreme weather events, including heat
   waves and large temperature fluctuations, to occur more frequently. Such
   changes may result in a reorganization of the plankton community
   structure, causing shifts in diversity and structure toward a community
   dominated by fewer species that are more adapted to endure warmer and
   irregular temperature conditions. We designed a long-term (8 months)
   mesocosm experiment to explore how ambient water temperature (C:
   control), induced increased temperature (T: +4 degrees C), and
   temperature fluctuations (F: +/- 4 degrees C relative to T) change
   phytoplankton phenology, taxonomical diversity, and community structure,
   and how such changes affected zooplankton abundance and composition.
   Synthesis. Our results show that T and F relative to C significantly
   decreased phytoplankton diversity. Moreover, there was a clear effect of
   the temperature treatments (T and F) on phytoplankton size structure
   that resulted in a significantly lower growth of large species (i.e.,
   large Chlorophyta) compared to C. Decreased diversity and evenness in
   the T and F treatments pushed the community toward the dominance of only
   a few phytoplankton taxa (mainly Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta) that are
   better adapted to endure warmer and more irregular temperature
   conditions. The observed shift toward Cyanobacteria dominance may affect
   trophic energy transfer along the aquatic food web.},

Title = {Long-term monitoring reveals forest tree community change driven by
   atmospheric sulphate pollution and contemporary climate change},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {270-283},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aim Montane environments are sentinels of global change, providing
   unique opportunities to assess impacts on species diversity. Multiple
   anthropogenic stressors such as climate change and atmospheric pollution
   may act concurrently or synergistically in restructuring communities.
   Thus, a major challenge for conservation is untangling the relative
   importance of different stressors. Here, we combine long-term monitoring
   with multivariate community modelling to estimate the anthropogenic
   drivers shaping forest tree diversity along an elevational gradient.
   Location Camels Hump Mountain, Vermont, USA. Methods We used Generalized
   Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM) to model spatial and temporal turnover in
   beta diversity along an elevational gradient over a 50-year period and
   tested for spatiotemporal shifts in density and elevational distribution
   of individual species. GDMs were used to predict community turnover as
   nonlinear functions of changes in elevation, climate and atmospheric
   pollution. Results We observed significant shifts in elevational range
   and density of individual species, which contributed to an overall
   reduction in the elevational gradient in beta diversity through time.
   GDMs showed the combined effects of sulphate deposition and temperature
   as drivers of this temporal reduction in beta diversity. Spatiotemporal
   changes differed among species, with shifts observed both up- and
   downslope. For example, in a reversal of a previous upslope range
   contraction, red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) increased in density and
   shifted downslope since the 1990s, occupying warmer, drier climates.
   Main conclusion Our results demonstrate that global change is impacting
   the stratification of forest tree diversity along elevational gradients,
   but the responses of individual species are complex and variable in
   direction. We suggest abiotic drivers may directly impact individual
   species while also indirectly altering species interactions along
   elevational gradients. Our approach modelling the drivers of
   compositional turnover quantifies the rate and amount of change in beta
   diversity along environmental gradients and serves as a powerful
   complement to studying species-specific responses.},

Title = {Diversity and specialization responses to climate and land use differ
   between deadwood fungi and bacteria},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 18},
Abstract = {Climate and land use are major determinants of biodiversity, and
   declines in species richness in cold and human exploited landscapes can
   be caused by lower rates of biotic interactions. Deadwood fungi and
   bacteria interact strongly with their hosts due to long-lasting
   evolutionary trajectories. However, how rates of biotic interactions
   (specialization) change with temperature and land-use intensity are
   unknown for both microbial groups. We hypothesize a decrease in species
   richness and specialization of communities with decreasing temperature
   and increasing land use intensity while controlling for precipitation.
   We used a full-factorial nested design to disentangle land use at
   habitat and landscape scale and temperature spanning an area of 300 x
   300 km in Germany. We exposed four deadwood objects representing the
   main tree species in Central Europe (beech, oak, spruce, pine) in 175
   study plots. Overall, we found that fungal and bacterial richness,
   community composition and specialization were weakly related to
   temperature and land use. Fungal richness was slightly higher in
   near-natural than in urban landscapes. Bacterial richness was positively
   associated with mean annual temperature, negatively associated with
   local temperature and highest in grassland habitats. Bacterial richness
   was positively related to the covariate mean annual precipitation. We
   found strong effects of host-tree identity on species richness and
   community composition. A generally high level of fungal host-tree
   specialization might explain the weak response to temperature and land
   use. Effects of host-tree identity and specialization were more
   pronounced in fungi. We suggest that host tree changes caused by land
   use and climate change will be more important for fungal communities,
   while changes in climate will affect bacterial communities more
   directly. Contrasting responses of the two taxonomic groups suggest a
   reorganization of deadwood microbial communities, which might have
   further consequences on diversity and decomposition in the Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {Global change puts coastal marine systems under pressure, affecting
   community structure and functioning. Here, we conducted a mesocosm
   experiment with an integrated multiple driver design to assess the
   impact of future global change scenarios on plankton, a key component of
   marine food webs. The experimental treatments were based on the RCP 6.0
   and 8.5 scenarios developed by the IPCC, which were Extended (ERCP) to
   integrate the future predicted changing nutrient inputs into coastal
   waters. We show that simultaneous influence of warming, acidification,
   and increased N:P ratios alter plankton dynamics, favours smaller
   phytoplankton species, benefits microzooplankton, and impairs
   mesozooplankton. We observed that future environmental conditions may
   lead to the rise of Emiliania huxleyi and demise of Noctiluca
   scintillans, key species for coastal planktonic food webs. In this
   study, we identified a tipping point between ERCP 6.0 and ERCP 8.5
   scenarios, beyond which alterations of food web structure and dynamics
   are substantial.
   Climate model-informed experiments indicate that marine plankton food
   webs may be restructured in the future. There exists a tipping point
   where a crucial plankton community structure changes under increased
   nitrogen to phosphorous ratios, pCO(2) and temperature.},

Abstract = {The anticipated impacts of climate change on aquatic biota are difficult
   to evaluate because of potentially contrasting effects of temperature
   and hydrology on lake ecosystems, particularly those closed-basin lakes
   within semiarid regions. To address this shortfall, we quantified
   decade-scale changes in chemical and biological properties of 20
   endorheic lakes in central North America in response to a pronounced
   transition from a drought to a pluvial period during the early 21st
   century. Lakes exhibited marked temporal changes in chemical
   characteristics and formed two discrete clusters corresponding to
   periods of substantially different effective moisture (as Palmer Drought
   Severity Index, PDSI). Discriminant function analysis (DFA) explained
   90\% of variability in fish assemblage composition and showed that fish
   communities were predicted best by environmental conditions during the
   arid interval (PDSI <-2). DFA also predicted that lakes could support
   more fish species during pluvial periods, but their occurrences may be
   limited by periodic stress due to recurrent droughts and physical
   barriers to colonization. Zooplankton taxonomic assemblages in fishless
   lakes were resilient to short-term changes in meteorological conditions,
   and did not vary between drought and deluge periods. Conversely,
   zooplankton taxa in fish-populated lakes decreased substantially in
   biomass during the wet interval, likely due to increased zooplanktivory
   by fish. The powerful effects of such climatic variability on hydrology
   and the strong subsequent links to water chemistry and biota indicate
   that future changes in global climate could result in significant
   restructuring of aquatic communities. Together these findings suggest
   that semiarid lakes undergoing temporary climate shifts provide a useful
   model system for anticipating the effects of global climate change on
   lake food webs.},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {548-561},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Current climate change and overfishing are affecting the productivity
   and structure of marine ecosystems. This situation is unprecedented for
   the marine biosphere and it is essential to understand the mechanisms
   and pathways by which ecosystems respond. We report that climate change
   and overfishing are likely to be responsible for a rapid restructuring
   of a highly productive marine ecosystem with effects throughout the
   pelagos and the benthos. In the mid-1980s, climate change, consequent
   modifications in the North Sea plankton, and fishing, all reduced North
   Sea cod recruitment. In this region, production of many benthic species
   respond positively and immediately to temperature. Analysis of a
   long-term, spatially extensive biological (plankton and cod) and
   physical (sea surface temperature) dataset suggests that synchronous
   changes in cod numbers and sea temperature have established an extensive
   trophic cascade favoring lower trophic level groups over economic
   fisheries. A proliferation of jellyfish that we detect may signal the
   climax of these changes. This modified North Sea ecology may provide a
   clear indication of the synergistic consequences of coincident climate
   change and overfishing. The extent of the ecosystem restructuring that
   has occurred in the North Sea suggests we are unlikely to reverse
   current climate and human-induced effects through ecosystem resource
   management in the short term. Rather, we should understand and adapt to
   new ecological regimes. This implies that fisheries management policies
   will have to be fully integrated with the ecological consequences of
   climate change to prevent a similar collapse in an exploited marine
   ecosystem elsewhere.},

Title = {Variation in upper thermal tolerance among 19 species from temperate
   wetlands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Communities usually possess a multitude of interconnected trophic
   interactions within food webs. Their regulation generally depends on a
   balance between bottom-up and top-down effects. However, if sensitivity
   to temperature varies among species, rising temperatures may change
   trophic interactions via direct and indirect effects. We examined the
   critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of 19 species from temperate wetlands
   (insect predators, amphibian larvae, zooplankton and amphipods) and
   determined if they vary in their sensitivity to warming temperatures.
   CTmax differed between the groups, with predatory insects having higher
   CTmax than amphibians (both herbivorous larval anurans and predatory
   larval salamanders), amphipods and zooplankton. In a scenario of global
   warming, these differences in thermal tolerance may affect top-down and
   bottom-up processes, particularly considering that insect predators are
   more likely to maintain or improve their performance at higher
   temperatures, which could lead to increased predation rates on the
   herbivores in the food web. Further studies are needed to understand how
   the energy flows through communities, how species? energy budgets may
   change and whether other physiological and behavioral responses (such as
   phenotypic plasticity and thermoregulation) can buffer or increase these
   changes in the top-down regulation of wetland food webs.},

Abstract = {Extreme climatic events can trigger sudden but often long-lasting
   impacts in ecosystems by causing near to complete mortality of
   foundation (habitat-forming) species. The magnitude and frequency of
   such events are expected to rise due to anthropogenic climate change,
   but the impacts that such events have on many foundation species and the
   ecosystems that they support remains poorly understood. In many cases,
   manipulative experimentation is extremely challenging and rarely
   feasible at a large scale. In late 2015 to early 2016, an extensive area
   of mangrove forest along similar to 1000 km of coastline in the Gulf of
   Carpentaria, Australia, experienced severe dieback, an event associated
   with climatic extremes. To assess the effect this dieback event had on
   the mangrove ecosystem, we assessed benthic faunal assemblages and food
   web structure using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in a comparative
   experiment of impacted forest and adjacent unimpacted forest. Eighteen
   months after the dieback, the forest that suffered dieback contained
   significantly fewer crabs that rely on mangrove litter food source but
   more crabs that rely on microphytobenthos food source than the
   unimpacted forest. However, the infaunal biomass was largely unaffected
   by the mortality effect. This is most likely because microphytobenthos
   was largely unaffected and consequently, this buffered the food web
   responses. However, overall, the habitat value for mangrove ecosystem
   services most likely decreased due to lower physical habitat complexity
   following tree mortality. Longer-term monitoring could lead to better
   understanding of biological effects of this extreme event and underlying
   biological mechanisms that drive changes and recovery.},

Abstract = {Growing evidence has shown a profound modification of plankton
   communities of the North East Atlantic and adjacent seas over the past
   decades. This drastic change has been attributed to a modification of
   the environmental conditions that regulate the dynamics and the spatial
   distribution of ectothermic species in the ocean. Recently, several
   studies have highlighted modifications of the regional climate station
   L4 (50 degrees 15.00'N, 4 degrees 13.02'W) in the Western English
   Channel. We here focus on the modification of the plankton community by
   studying the long-term, annual and seasonal changes of five zooplankton
   groups and eight copepod genera. We detail the main composition and the
   phenology of the plankton communities during four climatic periods
   identified at the L4 station: 1988-1994, 1995-2000, 2001-2007 and
   2008-2012. Our results show that long-term environmental changes
   underlined by Molinero et al. (2013) drive a profound restructuration of
   the plankton community modifying the phenology and the dominance of key
   planktonic groups including fish larvae. Consequently, the slow but deep
   modifications detected in the plankton community highlight a climate
   driven ecosystem shift in the Western English Channel. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {The unprecedented rate of global warming requires a better understanding
   of how ecosystems will respond. Organisms often have smaller body sizes
   under warmer climates (Bergmann's rule and the temperature-size rule),
   and body size is a major determinant of life histories, demography,
   population size, nutrient turnover rate, and food-web structure.
   Therefore, by altering body sizes in whole communities, current warming
   can potentially disrupt ecosystem function and services. However, the
   underlying drivers of warming-induced body downsizing remain far from
   clear. Here, we show that thermal clines in body size are predicted from
   universal laws of ecology and metabolism, so that size-dependent
   selection from competition (both intra and interspecific) and predation
   favors smaller individuals under warmer conditions. We validate this
   prediction using 4.1x10(6) individual body size measurements from French
   river fish spanning 29years and 52 species. Our results suggest that
   warming-induced body downsizing is an emergent property of
   size-structured food webs, and highlight the need to consider trophic
   interactions when predicting biosphere reorganizations under global
   warming.},

Abstract = {Forecasting impacts of future climate change is an important challenge
   to biologists, both for understanding the consequences of different
   emissions trajectories and for developing adaptation measures that will
   minimize biodiversity loss. Existing variation provides a window into
   the effects of climate on species and ecosystems, but in many places
   does not encompass the levels or timeframes of forcing expected under
   directional climatic change. Experiments help us to fill in these
   uncertainties, simulating directional shifts to examine outcomes of new
   levels and sustained changes in conditions. Here, we explore the
   translation between short-term responses to climate variability and
   longer-term trajectories that emerge under directional climatic change.
   In a decade-long experiment, we compare effects of short-term and
   long-term forcings across three trophic levels in grassland plots
   subjected to natural and experimental variation in precipitation. For
   some biological responses (plant productivity), responses to long-term
   extension of the rainy season were consistent with short-term responses,
   while for others (plant species richness, abundance of invertebrate
   herbivores and predators), there was pronounced divergence of long-term
   trajectories from short-term responses. These differences between
   biological responses mean that sustained directional changes in climate
   can restructure ecological relationships characterizing a system.
   Importantly, a positive relationship between plant diversity and
   productivity turned negative under one scenario of climate change, with
   a similar change in the relationship between plant productivity and
   consumer biomass. Inferences from experiments such as this form an
   important part of wider efforts to understand the complexities of
   climate change responses.},

Title = {Declining glacier cover threatens the biodiversity of alpine river
   diatom assemblages},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {12},
Pages = {5828-5840},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change poses a considerable threat to the biodiversity of high
   altitude ecosystems worldwide, including cold-water river systems that
   are responding rapidly to a shrinking cryosphere. Most recent research
   has demonstrated the severe vulnerability of river invertebrates to
   glacier retreat but effects upon other aquatic groups remain poorly
   quantified. Using new data sets from the European Alps, we show
   significant responses to declining glacier cover for diatoms, which play
   a critical functional role as freshwater primary producers.
   Specifically, diatom alpha-diversity and density in rivers presently fed
   by glaciers will increase with future deglaciation, yet beta-diversity
   within and between sites will reduce because declining glacier influence
   will lower the spatiotemporal variability of glacier cover and its
   associated habitat heterogeneity. Changes in diatom assemblage
   composition as glacier cover declined were associated strongly with
   increasing riverbed stability and water temperature. At the species
   level, diatoms showed a gradation of responses; for example, Eunotia
   trinacria, found exclusively at river sites with high (>= 52\%)
   catchment glacier cover, may be affected negatively by ice loss.
   Conversely, seven taxa confined to sites with no glacier cover,
   including Gomphonema calcareum, stand to benefit. Nineteen (22\%) taxa
   were noted as threatened, endangered, rare or decreasing on the Red List
   of Algae for Germany, with most at sites <= 26\% glacier cover, meaning
   further ice loss may benefit these diatoms. However, six taxa found only
   in rivers >= 28\% glacier cover may require reclassification of their
   Red List conservation status, as this habitat is threatened by
   deglaciation. Our identification of clear links between decreasing
   glacier cover and river diatom biodiversity suggests there could be
   significant reorganization of river ecosystems with deglaciation, for
   example, through alterations to primary production, biogeochemical
   cycles, and the shifting resource base of alpine freshwater food webs
   which lack significant allochthonous energy inputs.},

Title = {Disassembled Food Webs and Messy Projections: Modern Ungulate
   Communities in the Face of Unabating Human Population Growth},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {The human population grows inexorably. When Charles Darwin explored the
   southern cone of South America in 1830, fewer than 1.2 billion people
   inhabited Earth. When Ehrlich'sPopulation Bombappeared in 1968, there
   were similar to 3.5 billion people. We approach eight billion today, and
   biospheric impacts do not abate. We have affected most life forms
   through climate modification, harvest, erasure and fragmentation of
   habitat, disease, and the casting of alien species. Given the lack of
   abatement in human population growth, herein we focus on the modalities
   of ecological disruption-direct and indirect-that mitigate the changing
   role of ungulates in landscapes. Much of what was once generally
   predictable in terms of pattern and process is no longer. Offshore
   climatic events have strong onshore consequences, as exemplified by
   toxic algal blooms in the Patagonian Pacific. These have diminished the
   harvest of fish and likely resulted in fishermen using dogs to hunt
   huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus), the most endangered large terrestrial
   mammal of the Western Hemisphere. Similarly, human economies foment
   change in the Himalayan realm and Gobi Desert by increasing the number
   of cashmere-producing goats, and where dogs that once followed tourists
   or guarded livestock now hunt a half-dozen threatened, endangered, and
   rare ungulates, including kiang (Equus kiang), chiru (Pantholops
   hodgsonii), saiga (Saiga tatarica), and takin (Budorcas taxicolor),
   spread disease, and displace snow leopards (Panthera uncia). In North
   America's Great Basin Desert, 100 years of intense livestock grazing
   created a phase shift by which changed plant communities enabled mule
   deer (Odocoileus hemionus) colonization. An altered predator-prey system
   ensued with the arrival of pumas (Puma concolor). Patterns of resilience
   postulated byHolling (1973)become more difficult to witness in the
   absence of humans as our domination of Earth destabilizes systems beyond
   return points. These include ungulates both in and out of protected
   areas. Consequently, only messy projections of future community
   reorganization seem reasonable, whether related tofood websorassembly
   rulesthat once governed ungulate communities of the very recent past.},

   Arctic marine food web functioning?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Volume = {211},

Abstract = {\textbackslash{} Studying long-term trends of contaminants in Arctic
   biota is essential to better understand impacts of anthropogenic
   activities and climate change on the exposure of sensitive species and
   marine ecosystems. We concurrently measured temporal changes (2006-2014)
   in mercury (Hg) contamination of little auks (Alle alle; the most
   abundant Arctic seabird) and in their major zooplankton prey species
   (Calanoid copepods, Themisto libellula, Gammarus spp.). We found an
   increasing contamination of the food-chain in East Greenland during
   summer over the last decade. More specifically, bird contamination
   (determined by body feather analyses) has increased at a rate of 3.4\%
   per year. Conversely, bird exposure to Hg during winter in the northwest
   Atlantic (determined by head feather analyses) decreased over the study
   period (at a rate of 1.5\% per year), although winter concentrations
   remained consistently higher than during summer. By combining mercury
   levels measured in birds and zooplankton to isotopic analyses, our
   results demonstrate that inter-annual variations of Hg levels in little
   auks reflect changes in food-chain contamination, rather than a
   reorganization of the food web and a modification of seabird trophic
   ecology. They therefore underline the value of little auks, and Arctic
   seabirds in general, as bio-indicators of long-term changes in
   environmental contamination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   degrees C.
   3. Marked changes occurred in plankton community structure; the
   distribution of both plankton and intertidal organisms was affected,
   with latitudinal shifts of up to 120 miles; there were increases or
   decreases of 2-3 orders of magnitude in abundance.
   4. Warm water species increased in abundance and extended their range
   during periods of warming, while cold-water species declined or
   retreated; the reverse occurred during the period of cooling.
   5. Climate change can influence marine communities by a combination of:
   direct effect on the organisms; effects mediated by biotic interactions;
   and indirectly through ocean currents.
   6. From climate models that indicate rises of mean temperature of 2
   degrees C in the next 50 years, and from the observed changes, we can
   expect future latitudinal shifts of 200-400 miles in distribution of
   plankton, fish and benthos, with extensive restructuring of planktonic,
   pelagic and benthic communities.
   7. Species common now in the Bay of Biscay will become common in the
   English Channel; those presently restricted to the western English
   Channel could colonise the central Irish Sea; changes in community
   structure could lead to lower abundances of infaunal benthos and fish.
   8. To fully prove the effects of global warming, future changes in the
   marine biota must exceed those recorded in the 1950s and 1960s.},

Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1107-1124},

Abstract = {The physical environments of high-latitude systems are rapidly changing.
   For example, the Chukchi Sea has experienced increased water
   temperatures, advection from the Bering Sea, declines in sea-ice
   concentration, earlier spring ice retreat, and delayed fall ice
   formation. This physical restructuring is expected to impact ecosystem
   structure and function. In this study, a series of bio-oceanographic
   research surveys were conducted in the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012
   to characterize the physical environment and to examine the influence of
   physical forcing on zooplankton community distribution and abundance.
   Results revealed yearly advection from the Bering Sea influenced
   zooplankton community structure, but this influence became less apparent
   in the northeastern Chukchi due to changes in current speeds and
   patterns. Decreased advection and later ice retreat in colder years
   resulted in zooplankton communities that exhibited more diversity, had
   higher abundances of the lipid-rich copepod Calanus glacialis, and were
   less closely related to water masses advected from the south. These
   findings suggest more localized processes are influencing zooplankton
   community structure in the Chukchi Sea. Increased inflow of water into
   the Chukchi is predicted with increased warming in the Arctic and
   changes in food-web structure and function are likely to result.},

Title = {Paleoecological evidence for a multi-trophic regime shift in a
   perialpine lake (Lake Joux, Switzerland)},
Journal = {ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are under new and increasing threats from
   anthropogenic change. Ability to detect and predict consequences of
   environmental perturbations on ecosystem function and water quality is
   limited by the lack of empirical data over relevant time scales.
   Paleoecological records present a unique opportunity to broaden
   understanding of ecological transitions over decadal to millennial
   timescales. This study tested the occurrence of regime shifts to track
   changes throughout the lake food web beyond the typical instrumental
   era, using both ``traditional{''} paleoecological proxies (e.g.,
   cladoceran zooplankton, zoobenthos, and pigments) and more recently
   developed molecular genetic methods based on sedimentary DNA. We used
   sediment cores from the perialpine Lake Joux (Swiss Jura), where the
   history of human settlement and land-use practices in the catchment has
   been well documented since the Medieval period. Paleoecological evidence
   revealed an abrupt and unprecedented biological reorganization in the
   second half of the 20th century, following several centuries of
   relatively stable communities despite growing human pressure.
   Time-varying autoregression computed using dynamic linear modelling
   identified this transition, triggered by the onset of rapid cultural
   eutrophication in the 1950s, as a true regime shift. Since this time,
   despite decades of re-oligotrophication, biotic communities of Lake Joux
   have not returned to pre-disturbance composition, most likely due to
   other confounding factors, including climate warming, that may prevent
   the lake from returning to an earlier equilibrium state. Paleoecological
   reconstruction further suggested that cladocerans responded earlier to
   disturbance, which is highly relevant for lake monitoring and management
   strategies.},

Title = {Invasive trout increase the climatic sensitivity of zooplankton
   communities in naturally fishless lakes},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {60},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1502-1513},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. Widespread stocking of fish into naturally fishless montane lakes has
   restructured their food webs by excluding invertebrate top predators and
   releasing smaller zooplankton from predation and competition. The
   persistence of non-native trout in these lakes may also compound the
   effects of global warming, such that current efforts to manage these two
   stressors independently may be ineffective.
   2. We conducted a survey of 22 naturally fishless and stocked lakes
   positioned along an altitudinal (and thus climatic) gradient and a
   two-factor experiment using outdoor mesocosms. We hypothesised that
   stocked rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) increase the effects of
   higher temperature on zooplankton production in naturally fishless lakes
   by suppressing large invertebrates (e.g. Chaoborus), which then releases
   from predation smaller species that are more sensitive to warming. We
   also expected that introduced trout would stimulate primary production
   by suppressing larger grazers and increasing nutrient availability.
   3. The survey confirmed that non-native trout and temperature are
   significant explanatory variables of zooplankton species turnover. Both
   lines of evidence agreed that the positive influence of higher
   temperature on total zooplankton biomass occurred only in the presence
   of non-native trout, probably because warming stimulated reproduction of
   smaller, herbivorous species that are favoured in lakes with stocked
   fish. Otherwise, the direct effects of higher temperatures on fishless
   communities were negligible. The positive effect of fish on primary
   production also probably provided the extra food to support greater
   reproduction by these small herbivorous species under warmed conditions.
   4. Stocking trout into naturally fishless montane lakes increases the
   sensitivity of their zooplankton to the otherwise subtle direct effects
   of higher temperature. The likely effect of global warming on food webs
   in montane lakes may depend on their trophic structure, and the
   destabilizing influence of introduced fish.},

Title = {Climate and fishing steer ecosystem regeneration to uncertain economic

Volume = {282},

Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {Overfishing of large predatory fish populations has resulted in lasting
   restructurings of entire marine food webs worldwide, with serious
   socioeconomic consequences. Fortunately, some degraded ecosystems show
   signs of recovery. A key challenge for ecosystem management is to
   anticipate the degree to which recovery is possible. By applying a
   statistical food-web model, using the Baltic Sea as a case study, we
   show that under current temperature and salinity conditions, complete
   recovery of this heavily altered ecosystem will be impossible. Instead,
   the ecosystem regenerates towards a new ecological baseline. This new
   baseline is characterized by lower and more variable biomass of cod, the
   commercially most important fish stock in the Baltic Sea, even under
   very low exploitation pressure. Furthermore, a socio-economic assessment
   shows that this signal is amplified at the level of societal costs,
   owing to increased uncertainty in biomass and reduced consumer surplus.
   Specifically, the combined economic losses amount to approximately 120
   million E per year, which equals half of today's maximum economic yield
   for the Baltic cod fishery. Our analyses suggest that shifts in
   ecological and economic baselines can lead to higher economic
   uncertainty and costs for exploited ecosystems, in particular, under
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Canopy-forming seaweeds are important coastal ecosystem engineers that
   sustain diverse multi-trophic assemblages. Their losses, with the
   subsequent reduction in habitat complexity, have been documented across
   many parts of the world and are often attributed to climate change and
   other anthropogenic factors. The general aim of the present study was to
   understand the repercussions of the decline of the canopy-forming alga
   Fucus serratus L. at its retreating southern range edge in the diversity
   and food-web linkages of intertidal assemblages. Few studies have
   attempted to document changes in benthic food webs following canopy
   loss. We examined the differences among southern locations situated at
   different distances from the range margin: those at the very edge, where
   F. serratus experienced a dramatic decline during recent years (marginal
   locations), and those where F. serratus is still dominant (central
   locations). Comparisons were made among locations situated at the same
   latitude and sharing a recent history of F. serratus dominance. Trophic
   relationships were analyzed using natural abundances of carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotopes. We report clear changes in the structure of
   benthic assemblages and lower trophic positioning of some consumers,
   suggesting an overall shrinkage of the food web length at the
   contracting range edge of F. serratus, which will transfer to higher
   trophic levels. Under present and future climatic scenarios, shifts in
   the distribution of coastal ecosystem engineers could entail a
   reorganization of local natural assemblages and food webs. More
   attention should be given to measure how much these shifts can modify
   the whole coastal food webs and their functioning.},

Abstract = {Global warming generates changes in environmental conditions, affecting
   the spatial -temporal dynamics of precipitation and temperature.
   Droughts, events of low rainfall, are becoming more frequent and severe.
   In central Chile, from 2010 to date, an unprecedented drought event has
   developed, affecting the ecosystem and creating pressure on the dynamics
   of food webs. The present study analysed the trophic ecology of Bubo
   magellanicus, a top predator in the Mediterranean region of Chile,
   between 2019 and 2020 a period with a rainfall deficit of 72.6\%. Our
   results established a diet mainly described by invertebrates (97.75\%),
   in particular by the Gramnostola rosea spider (87.86\%), and a low
   contribution of small vertebrates (2.24\%). The trophic niche breadth (B
   = 0.37) and the standardised Levin's index (BSTA = 0.01) are the lowest
   recorded in the species B. magellanicus. A comparative analysis of
   trophic ecology with other studies developed in the same region
   established significant differences in the composition of the diet
   (frequency of occurrence of prey unit). This work provides evidence that
   droughts and other extreme environmental scenarios restructure the food
   webs of an ecosystem, with direct consequences on the trophic niche of
   the species, specifically top predators.},

Title = {Can landscape heterogeneity promote carnivore coexistence in
   human-dominated landscapes?},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Context Interspecific competition can limit species distributions unless
   competitors partition niche space to enable coexistence. Landscape
   heterogeneity can facilitate niche partitioning and enable coexistence,
   but land-use change is restructuring terrestrial ecosystems globally
   with unknown consequences for species interactions. Objectives We tested
   the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and carnivore
   co-occurrence in natural and human-dominated ecosystems to assess the
   landscape-mediated impacts of anthropogenic change on coexistence.
   Methods We used boosted regression trees to model the distributions and
   co-occurrence of two competing forest carnivores, American martens and
   fishers, at two contrasting sites in the Great Lakes region, USA: a
   ``natural{''} site largely devoid of human impacts and a
   ``human-dominated{''} site with substantial development and a history of
   land-use change. We assessed the importance of climate and habitat
   variables for each species, measured spatial niche overlap, and
   quantified co-occurrence as a function of compositional (patch
   richness), configurational (landscape shape), and topographical
   (elevation range) heterogeneity per site. Results We observed
   significant differences in the effect of heterogeneity on co-occurrence
   between sites. The natural landscape exhibited little niche overlap and
   co-occurrence had a significant, positive relationship with
   heterogeneity. Conversely, the human-dominated site exhibited high niche
   overlap with variable effects of heterogeneity on co-occurrence.
   Elevation, snowpack, and development had strong, contrasting effects on
   marten and fisher distributions, suggesting that differential use of
   habitat and anthropogenic features facilitates coexistence. Conclusions
   Heterogeneity can facilitate coexistence, but too much may undermine
   carnivore coexistence in human-dominated landscapes where habitat and
   space are limited. Moreover, future climate change will likely erode
   niche partitioning among martens and fishers, with particularly strong
   consequences for coexistence in human-dominated landscapes and at range
   boundaries.},

Title = {Environmentally induced functional shifts in phytoplankton and their

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2804-2819},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Phytoplanktonic organisms are particularly sensitive to environmental
   change, and, as they represent a direct link between abiotic and biotic
   compartments within the marine food web, changes in the functional
   structure of phytoplankton communities can result in profound impacts on
   ecosystem functioning. Using a trait-based approach, we examined changes
   in the functional structure of the southern North Sea phytoplankton over
   the past five decades in relation to environmental conditions. We
   identified a shift in functional structure between 1998 and 2004 which
   coincides with a pronounced increase in diatom and decrease in
   dinoflagellate abundances, and we provide a mechanistic explanation for
   this taxonomic change. Early in the 2000s, the phytoplankton functional
   structure shifted from slow growing, autumn blooming, mixotrophic
   organisms, towards earlier blooming and faster-growing microalgae.
   Warming and decreasing dissolved phosphorus concentrations were linked
   to this rapid reorganization of the functional structure. We identified
   a potential link between this shift and dissolved nutrient
   concentrations, and we hypothesise that organisms blooming early and
   displaying high growth rates efficiently take up nutrients which then
   are no longer available to late bloomers. Moreover, we identified that
   the above-mentioned functional change may have bottom-up consequences,
   through a food quality-driven negative influence on copepod abundances.
   Overall, our study highlights that, by altering the phytoplankton
   functional composition, global and regional changes may have profound
   long-term impacts on coastal ecosystems, impacting both food-web
   structure and biogeochemical cycles.},

Abstract = {Abrupt and rapid ecosystem shifts (where major reorganizations of
   food-web and community structures occur), commonly termed regime shifts,
   are changes between contrasting and persisting states of ecosystem
   structure and function. These shifts have been increasingly reported for
   exploited marine ecosystems around the world from the North Pacific to
   the North Atlantic. Understanding the drivers and mechanisms leading to
   marine ecosystem shifts is crucial in developing adaptive management
   strategies to achieve sustainable exploitation of marine ecosystems. An
   international workshop on a comparative approach to analysing these
   marine ecosystem shifts was held at Hamburg University, Institute for
   Hydrobiology and Fisheries Science, Germany on 1-3 November 2010.
   Twenty-seven scientists from 14 countries attended the meeting,
   representing specialists from seven marine regions, including the Baltic
   Sea, the North Sea, the Barents Sea, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean
   Sea, the Bay of Biscay and the Scotian Shelf off the Canadian East
   coast. The goal of the workshop was to conduct the first large-scale
   comparison of marine ecosystem regime shifts across multiple regional

Title = {Precipitation and ectoparasitism reduce reproductive success in an

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {Indirect impacts of climate change, mediated by new species interactions
   (including pathogens or parasites) will likely be key drivers of
   biodiversity reorganization. In addition, direct effects of extreme
   weather events remain understudied. Simultaneous investigation of the
   significance of ectoparasites on host populations and extreme weather
   events is lacking, especially in the Arctic. Here we document the
   consequences of recent black fly outbreaks and extreme precipitation
   events on the reproductive output of an arctic top predator, the
   peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus tundrius) nesting at the northern
   range limit of ornithophilic black flies in Nunavut, Canada. Overall,
   black fly outbreaks and heavy rain reduced annual nestling survival by
   up to 30\% and 50\% respectively. High mortality caused by ectoparasites
   followed record-breaking spring snow precipitation, which likely
   increased stream discharge and nutrient runoff, two key parameters
   involved in growth and survival of blackfly larvae. Using the RCP4.5
   intermediate climate scenario run under the Canadian Global Climate
   Model, we anticipate a northward expansion of blackfly distribution in
   Arctic regions. Our case study demonstrates that, in the context of
   climate change, extreme weather events can have substantial direct and
   indirect effects on reproductive output of an arctic top-predator
   population.},

Title = {Reorganization of a large marine ecosystem due to atmospheric and

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems such as the Baltic Sea are currently under strong
   atmospheric and anthropogenic pressure. Besides natural and
   human-induced changes in climate, major anthropogenic drivers such as
   overfishing and anthropogenic eutrophication are significantly affecting
   ecosystem structure and function. Recently, studies demonstrated the
   existence of alternative stable states in various terrestrial and
   aquatic ecosystems. These so-called ecosystem regime shifts have been
   explained mainly as a result of multiple causes, e.g. climatic regime
   shifts, overexploitation or a combination of both. The occurrence of
   ecosystem regime shifts has important management implications, as they
   can cause significant losses of ecological and economic resources.
   Because of hysteresis in ecosystem responses, restoring regimes
   considered as favourable may require drastic and expensive management
   actions. Also the Baltic Sea, the largest brackish water body in the
   world ocean, and its ecosystems are strongly affected by atmospheric and
   anthropogenic drivers. Here, we present results of an analysis of the
   state and development of the Central Baltic Sea ecosystem integrating
   hydroclimatic, nutrient, phyto- and zooplankton as well as fisheries
   data. Our analyses of 52 biotic and abiotic variables using multivariate
   statistics demonstrated a major reorganization of the ecosystem and
   identified two stable states between 1974 and 2005, separated by a
   transition period in 1988-1993. We show the change in Baltic ecosystem
   structure to have the characteristics of a discontinuous regime shift,
   initiated by climate-induced changes in the abiotic environment and
   stabilized by fisheries-induced feedback loops in the food web. Our
   results indicate the importance of maintaining the resilience of an
   ecosystem to atmospherically induced environmental change by reducing
   the anthropogenic impact.},

Abstract = {Across an elevation gradient, several biotic and abiotic factors
   influence community assemblages of interacting species leading to a

   Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspots in Kenya, East Africa. We recorded
   plant-bee interactions at 50 study sites between 515 and 2600 m asl for
   a full year, following all four major seasons in this region. We
   analysed elevational and seasonal network patterns using generalised
   additive models (GAMs) and quantified the influence of climate, floral
   resource availability, and bee diversity on network structures using a
   multimodel inference framework. We recorded 16,741 interactions among
   186 bee and 314 plant species of which a majority involved interactions
   with honeybees. We found that nestedness and bee species specialisation
   of plant-bee interaction networks increased with elevation and that the
   relationships were consistent in the cold-dry and warm-wet seasons
   respectively. Link rewiring increased in the warm-wet season with
   elevation but remained indifferent in the cold-dry seasons. Conversely,
   network modularity and plant species were more specialised at lower
   elevations during both the cold-dry and warm-wet seasons, with higher
   values observed during the warm-wet seasons. We found flower and bee
   species diversity and abundance rather than direct effects of climate
   variables to best predict modularity, specialisation, and link rewiring
   in plant-bee-interaction networks. This study highlights changes in
   network architectures with elevation suggesting a potential sensitivity
   of plant-bee interactions with climate warming and changes in rainfall
   patterns along the elevation gradients of the Eastern Afromontane

Abstract = {On deep time scales, changing climatic trends can have a predictable
   influence on macroevolution. From evidence of mass extinctions, we know
   that rapid climatic oscillations can indirectly open niche space and
   precipitate adaptive radiation, changing the course of ecological
   diversification. These dramatic shifts in the global climate, however,
   are rare events relative to extended periods of protracted climate
   change and biome turnover. it remains unclear whether during gradually
   changing periods, shifting habitats may instead promote non-adaptive
   speciation by facilitating allopatry and phenotypic conservatism. Using
   fossil-calibrated, species-level phylogenies for five Australian
   radiations comprising more than 800 species, we investigated temporal
   trends in biogeography and body size evolution. Here, we demonstrate
   that gradual Miocene cooling and aridification correlates with the
   restricted phenotypic diversification of multiple ecologically diverse
   vertebrate groups. This probably occurred as species ranges became
   fractured and isolated during continental biome restructuring,
   encouraging a shift towards conservatism in body size evolution. Our
   results provide further evidence that abiotic changes, not only biotic
   interactions, may act as selective forces influencing phenotypic
   macroevolution.},

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Marine microbial communities sustain ocean food webs and mediate global
   elemental cycles. These communities will change with climate; these
   changes can be gradual or foreseeable but likely have much more
   substantial consequences when sudden and unpredictable. In a complex
   virtual marine microbial ecosystem, we find that climate change-driven
   shifts over the 21st century are often abrupt, large in amplitude and
   extent, and unpredictable using standard early warning signals.
   Phytoplankton with unique resource needs, especially fast-growing
   species such as diatoms, are more prone to abrupt shifts. Abrupt shifts
   in biomass, productivity, and community structure are concentrated in
   Atlantic and Pacific subtropics. Abrupt changes in environmental
   variables such as temperature and nutrients rarely precede these
   ecosystem shifts, indicating that rapid community restructuring can
   occur in response to gradual environmental changes, particularly in
   nutrient supply rate ratios.},

Title = {Phytoplankton competition and resilience under fluctuating temperature},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Environmental variability is an inherent feature of natural systems
   which complicates predictions of species interactions. Primarily, the
   complexity in predicting the response of organisms to environmental
   fluctuations is in part because species' responses to abiotic factors
   are non-linear, even in stable conditions. Temperature exerts a major
   control over phytoplankton growth and physiology, yet the influence of
   thermal fluctuations on growth and competition dynamics is largely
   unknown. To investigate the limits of coexistence in variable
   environments, stable mixed cultures with constant species abundance
   ratios of the marine diatoms, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and
   Thalassiosira pseudonana, were exposed to different temperature
   fluctuation regimes (n = 17) under high and low nitrogen (N) conditions.
   Here we demonstrate that phytoplankton exhibit substantial resilience to
   temperature variability. The time required to observe a shift in the
   species abundance ratio decreased with increasing fluctuations, but
   coexistence of the two model species under high N conditions was
   disrupted only when amplitudes of temperature fluctuation were high (+/-
   8.2 degrees C). N limitation caused the thermal amplitude for disruption
   of species coexistence to become lower (+/- 5.9 degrees C). Furthermore,
   once stable conditions were reinstated, the two species differed in
   their ability to recover from temperature fluctuations. Our findings
   suggest that despite the expectation of unequal effect of fluctuations
   on different competitors, cycles in environmental conditions may reduce
   the rate of species replacement when amplitudes remain below a certain
   threshold. Beyond these thresholds, competitive exclusion could,
   however, be accelerated, suggesting that aquatic heatwaves and N
   availability status are likely to lead to abrupt and unpredictable
   restructuring of phytoplankton community composition .},

Abstract = {Understanding species distributions and the variation of assemblage
   structure in time and space are fundamental goals of biogeography and
   ecology. Here, we use an ecological niche modeling and macroecological
   approach in order to assess whether constraints patterns in carnivoran
   richness and composition structures in replicated assemblages through
   time and space should reflect environmental filtering through ecological
   niche constraints from the Last Inter-glacial (LIG), Last Glacial
   Maximum (LGM) to the present (C) time. Our results suggest a diverse
   distribution of carnivoran co-occurrence patterns at the continental
   scale as a result of spatial climatic variation as an important driver
   constrained by the ecological niches of the species. This influence was
   an important factor restructuring assemblages (more directly on richness
   than composition patterns) not only at the continental level, but also
   from regional and local scales and this influence was geographically
   different throughout the space in the continent. These climatic
   restrictions and disruption of the niche during the environmental
   changes at the LIG-LGM-C transition show a considerable shift in
   assemblage richness and composition across the Americas, which suggests
   an environmental filtering mainly during the LGM, explaining between 30
   and 75\% of these variations through space and time, with more
   accentuated changes in North than South America. LGM was likely to be
   critical in species functional adaptation and distribution and therefore
   on assemblage structuring and rearranging from continental to local
   scales through time in the continent. Still, extinction processes are
   the result of many interacting factors, where climate is just one part
   of the picture.},

Title = {Joint effects of species traits and environmental preferences on range
   edge shifts of British birds},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 5},
Abstract = {Aim: Despite the strong evidence of species range shifts as a response
   to environmental change, attempts to identify species traits that
   modulate those shifts have been equivocal. We investigate the role of
   species traits and environmental preferences on birds' range shifts in
   Great Britain, an island where dispersal is limited by the English
   Channel and the North Sea.
   Location: Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales).
   Taxa: Birds (Aves).
   Time Period: 1968-2011.
   Methods: Using 404,949 occurrence records from two time periods, we
   investigated the potential drivers of leading and rear range edge shifts
   of breeding birds using phylogenetic linear mixed models. We
   hypothesized that shifts are influenced by species' trophic and
   morphological traits, dispersal abilities and environmental preferences,
   but also by the geographical boundaries of Great Britain.
   Results: Geographical boundaries-the distance from the northern or
   southern boundaries of Britain-accounted for most of the variability in
   range edge shifts. Species traits and environmental preferences emerged
   as relevant drivers of range shifts only for northern and Passeriform
   species. Northern habitat specialist, those with more predators and
   those sensitive to precipitation were more likely to shift their rear
   edge poleward. For Passeriformes, habitat generalists, species with
   smaller dispersal capabilities, under higher predatory pressure or
   associated with forest and grassland were more likely to shift their
   rear edge poleward.
   Main Conclusions: While geographical boundaries impose constraints on
   range shifts in British birds, the subtle effects of species traits and
   environmental preferences emerge as relevant predictors for Northern and
   passeriform species' rear edge shifts. This highlights the importance of
   accounting for geographical boundaries when predicting species responses
   to global change. Differential range shifts of species across different
   trophic levels could result in the reorganization of biotic
   interactions, with consequences for ecosystem structure and stability.},

Title = {Phylogenetic relatedness of food plants reveals highest insect herbivore
   specialization at intermediate temperatures along a broad climatic
   gradient},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The composition and richness of herbivore and plant assemblages change
   along climatic gradients, but knowledge about associated shifts in
   specialization is scarce and lacks controlling for the abundance and
   phylogeny of interaction partners. Thus, we aimed to test whether the
   specialization of phytophagous insects in insect-plant interaction
   networks decreases toward cold habitats as predicted by the `altitude
   niche-breadth hypothesis' to forecast possible consequences of
   interaction rewiring under climate change. We used a non-invasive,
   standardized metabarcoding approach to reconstruct dietary relationships
   of Orthoptera species as a major insect herbivore taxon along a broad
   temperature gradient (similar to 12 degrees C) in Southern Germany.
   Based on Orthoptera surveys, feeding observations, collection of fecal
   pellets from >3,000 individuals of 54 species, and parallel vegetation
   surveys on 41 grassland sites, we quantified plant resource availability
   and its use by herbivores. Herbivore assemblages were richer in species
   and individuals at sites with high summer temperatures, while plant
   richness peaked at intermediate temperatures. Corresponding interaction
   networks were most specialized in warm habitats. Considering
   phylogenetic relationships of plant resources, however, the
   specialization pattern was not linear but peaked at intermediate
   temperatures, mediated by herbivores feeding on a narrow range of
   phylogenetically related resources. Our study provides empirical
   evidence of resource specialization of insect herbivores along a
   climatic gradient, demonstrating that resource phylogeny, availability,
   and temperature interactively shape the specialization of herbivore
   assemblages. Instead of low specialization levels only in cold, harsh
   habitats, our results suggest increased generalist feeding due to
   intraspecific changes and compositional differences at both ends of the
   microclimatic gradient. We conclude that this nonlinear change of
   phylogeny-based resource specialization questions predictions derived
   from the `altitude-niche breadth hypothesis' and highlights the
   currently limited understanding of how plant-herbivore interactions will
   change under future climatic conditions.},

Title = {Species-specific ontogenetic diet shifts attenuate trophic cascades and

Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {128},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1051-1064},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Ontogenetic diet shifts are pervasive in food websbut rules governing
   their emergence and the implications for trophic cascades are only
   partly understood. Recent theoretical advances in multispecies size
   spectrum models (MSSMs) predict that the emergence of ontogenetic diet
   shifts are driven primarily by size-selective predation and changes in
   the relative abundances of suitably sized prey. Howeverthese assumptions
   have not yet been tested with data. Herewe developed alternative MSSMs
   based on different assumptions about the nature of species and
   size-based preferences and tested them using an extensive dietary
   database for the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS). MSSMs with both size and
   species-specific prey preferences correctly predicted approximately
   three-fold more of the diet links than those that assumed fixed species
   preferences. Importantlythese model assumptions also had a profound
   effect on the strength of fishing-induced trophic cascades and the
   emergent trophic structure of the community with and without fishing.
   The diet-informed models exhibited lower predation mortality
   ratesparticularly for small individuals (less than 1 g) whichin
   turnreduced the intensity and reach of fishing-induced trophic cascades
   up the size spectrum. If the level and size dependency of piscivory
   observed in EBS predators is typical of other systemsthe potential for
   fishing-induced trophic cascades may be over-stated in MSSMs as they are
   currently formulated and parameterized. Representation of
   species-specific ontogenetic shifts in diet can strongly influence
   system responses to perturbationsand the extensions we propose should
   accelerate adoption of MSSMs as frameworks for exploring size-based food
   web theory and developing modeling tools to support strategic management
   decisions.},

Abstract = {The effect of fishing on the marine ecosystem has been often summarized
   as the trend in the mean trophic level of the catch. This metric has
   been shown to be declining in many parts of the world, a trend popularly
   known as ``fishing down the food web.{''} The method has been
   criticized, however, because it typically considers only a single
   trophic level value for each component of the catch while considerable
   variation is known to exist in the food habits of marine organisms both
   seasonally and ontogenically. Examining the seasonal food habits of
   Pacific cod we determine that significant differences in trophic level
   exist both with increasing size of the cod as well as by season.
   However, adjusting the mean trophic level of the entire commercial catch
   for changing cod trophic levels does little to change the interpretation
   of. the status of Gulf of Alaska fisheries.},

Title = {Removing flowers of a generalist plant changes pollinator visitation,
   composition, and interaction network structure},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Pollination is essential for ecosystem functioning, yet our
   understanding of the empirical consequences of species loss for
   plant-pollinator interactions remains limited. It is hypothesized that
   the loss of abundant and generalized (well-connected) species from a
   pollination network will have a large effect on the remaining species
   and their interactions. However, to date, relatively few studies have
   experimentally removed species from their natural setting to address
   this hypothesis. We investigated the consequences of losing an abundant,
   generalist native species from a series of plant-pollinator networks by
   experimentally removing the flowers of Helianthella quinquenervis
   (Asteraceae) from half of a series of 10 paired plots (15 m diameter)
   within a subalpine ecosystem. We then asked how the localized loss of
   this species influenced patterns of pollinator visitation, floral
   visitor composition, and interaction network structure. The experimental
   removal of Helianthella flowers led to an overall decline in plot-level
   pollinator visitation rates and shifts in pollinator composition.
   Species-level responses to floral removal differed between the two other
   abundant, co-flowering plants in our experiment: Potentilla pulcherrima
   received higher visitation rates, whereas Erigeron speciosus visitation
   rates did not change. Experimental floral removal altered the structural
   properties of the localized plant-pollinator networks such that they
   were more specialized, less nested, and less robust to further species
   loss. Such changes to interaction network structure were consistently
   driven more by species turnover than by interaction rewiring. Our
   findings suggest that the local loss of an abundant, well-linked,
   generalist plant can bring about diverse responses within intact
   pollination networks, including potential competitive and facilitative
   effects for individual species, changes to network structure that may
   render them more sensitive to future change, but also numerous changes
   to interactions that may also suggest flexibility in response to species
   loss.},

Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {138},

Abstract = {The Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) continental shelf
   ecosystems show some similar and some distinctive groundfish biomass
   dynamics. Given that similar species occupy these regions and fisheries
   management is also comparable, similarities might be expected, but to
   what can we attribute the differences? Different types of ecosystem
   structure and control (e.g. top-down, bottom-up, mixed) can imply
   different ecosystem dynamics and climate interactions. Further, the
   structural type identified for a given ecosystem may suggest optimal
   management for sustainable fishing. Here, we use information on the
   current system state derived from food web models of both the EBS and
   the GOA combined with dynamic ecosystem models incorporating uncertainty
   to classify each ecosystem by its structural type. We then suggest how
   this structure might be generally related to dynamics and
   predictability. We find that the EBS and GOA have fundamentally
   different food web structures both overall, and when viewed from the
   perspective of the same commercially and ecologically important species
   in each system, walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus). EBS food web
   structure centers on a large mass of pollock, which appears to
   contribute to relative system stability and predictability. In contrast,
   GOA food web structure features high predator biomass, which contributes
   to a more dynamic, less predictable ecosystem. Mechanisms for climate
   influence on pollock production in the EBS are increasingly understood,
   while climate forcing mechanisms contributing to the potentially
   destabilizing high predator biomass in the GOA remain enigmatic. We
   present results of identical pollock fishing and climate-driven pollock
   recruitment simulations in the EBS and GOA which show different system
   responses, again with less predictable response in the GOA. Overall, our
   results suggest that identifying structural properties of fished food
   webs is as important for sustainable fisheries management as attempting
   to predict climate and fisheries effects within each ecosystem.

Title = {Deposit-feeder diets in the Bering Sea: potential effects of climatic
   loss of sea ice-related microalgal blooms},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1525-1542},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate warming in seasonally ice-covered seas is expected to reduce the
   extent and duration of annual sea ice. Resulting changes in sea ice
   related blooms of ice algae or phytoplankton may in turn alter the
   timing, magnitude, or quality of organic matter inputs to the sea floor.
   If benthic taxa rely differently on direct consumption of settling fresh
   microalgae for growth and reproduction, altered blooms may lead to
   reorganization of deposit-feeding assemblages. To assess the potential
   for such changes, we examined the diets of five abundant deposit-feeders
   (three infaunal bivalves, a polychaete, and a brittle star) with
   different feeding modes over the course of the spring bloom in May-June
   2007 in the north-central Bering Sea (30-90 m depth). Short-term data
   from gut contents reflected feeding modes, with the bivalves Macoma
   calcarea, Ennucula tenuis, and Nuculana radiata, and the brittle star
   Ophiura sarsi, responding more quickly to deposition of fresh algae than
   did the head-down polychaete Pectinaria hyperborea. Fatty acid
   biomarkers also indicated rapid ingestion of settling algae by the
   bivalves (especially Macoma) and the brittle star, while Pectinaria
   continued to ingest mainly bacteria. Fatty acid biomarkers did not
   indicate any unique dietary importance of ice algae released from
   melting ice. Longer-term inference from stable isotopes suggested that
   fresh microalgae contributed little to overall carbon assimilated by any
   of these species. Instead, deposit-feeders appeared to select a
   consistent fraction from the pool of sediment organic matter, probably
   heterotrophic microbes, microbial products, and reworked phytodetritus
   that form a longer-term sediment ``food bank.{''} Redistribution of
   settled organic matter via scouring and accumulation by currents, as
   well as the multi-year life spans of macroinvertebrates, may further
   overwhelm effects of short-term variations in the timing, magnitude, and
   dispersion of blooms in the water column. More diet data are needed from
   midsummer to account for any lag in assimilation of fresh microalgae at
   these cold temperatures. Nevertheless, our results suggest that if
   annual sea ice cover is reduced, increased production of phytoplankton
   during longer ice-free periods could replace inputs of ice-associated
   microalgae to the sediment food bank used by deposit-feeders.},

Title = {Responses of a soil mollusk community to an extreme cold event},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil communities are impacted by increasingly frequent and intense
   climate extremes. To accurately predict the effects of these events on
   soil communities and effectively design recovery and management programs
   for soil biodiversity, it is necessary to understand the spatiotemporal
   patterns and mechanisms underlying the soil community responses. Here,
   we investigated a mangrove soil macrofaunal (mollusk) community before
   and after an extreme cold event (ECE) to determine the effects of the
   ECE on the spatial pattern, temporal succession, and deterministic and
   stochastic processes affecting the soil metacommunity. We used
   distance-decay and time-decay analyses to characterize the spatial
   pattern and temporal succession of soil mollusk community dissimilarity
   (e. g., species identity, abundance, and biomass) across a reginal scale
   (similar to 350 km scale). We used null models to compare the relative
   importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping the
   regional soil mollusk community assembly. The ECE resulted in a
   reorganization of the soil mollusk metacommunity reflected by the
   mortality and extinction of several original species, colonization by
   new opportunistic species, and a significant reduction in mollusk
   abundance and biomass. The ECE increased divergent temporal succession
   but decreased spatial segregation in the soil mollusks, consistent with
   changes in the community dissimilarity of species abundance, richness,
   and biomass. The ECE increased the numbers of non-random segregated and
   random structures of soil mollusks while decreased the number of
   non-random aggregated communities. Notably, non-random segregated
   communities were the most strongly affected. Thus, the response of the
   soil mollusk metacommunity to the ECE was mediated by an increase in
   limiting similarity processes and stochastic processes and a decrease in
   limiting dissimilarity processes. The dominant limiting similarity
   processes involved species competition and/or dispersal limitation. More
   broadly, our study indicated that alterations in the spatiotemporal
   dynamics of soil fauna in response to climate change should be studied
   at the metacommunity scale. These spatiotemporal dynamics should be
   further tested in an ecological processes framework to reliably evaluate
   soil community responses to climate change and to devise management
   strategies for global soils.},

Abstract = {The ice-cover period in lakes is increasingly recognized for its
   distinct combination of physical and biological phenomena and ecological
   relevance. Knowledge gaps exist where research areas of hydrodynamics,
   biogeochemistry and biology intersect. For example, density-driven
   circulation under ice coincides with an expansion of the anoxic zone,
   but abiotic and biotic controls on oxygen depletion have not been
   disentangled, and while heterotrophic microorganisms and migrating
   phytoplankton often thrive at the oxycline, the extent to which physical
   processes induce fluxes of heat and substrates that support under-ice
   food webs is uncertain. Similarly, increased irradiance in spring can
   promote growth of motile phytoplankton or, if radiatively driven
   convection occurs, more nutritious diatoms, but links between functional
   trait selection, trophic transfer to zooplankton and fish, and the
   prevalence of microbial versus classical food webs in seasonally
   ice-covered lakes remain unclear. Under-ice processes cascade into and
   from the ice-free season, and are relevant to annual cycling of energy
   and carbon through aquatic food webs. Understanding the coupling between
   state transitions and the reorganization of trophic hierarchies is
   essential for predicting complex ecosystem responses to climate change.
   In this interdisciplinary review we describe existing knowledge of
   physical processes in lakes in winter and the parallel developments in
   under-ice biogeochemistry and ecology. We then illustrate interactions
   between these processes, identify extant knowledge gaps and present
   (novel) methods to address outstanding questions.},

Title = {Recent decline in the global land evapotranspiration trend due to
   limited moisture supply},
Journal = {NATURE},

Abstract = {More than half of the solar energy absorbed by land surfaces is
   currently used to evaporate water(1). Climate change is expected to
   intensify the hydrological cycle(2) and to alter evapotranspiration,
   with implications for ecosystem services and feedback to regional and
   global climate. Evapotranspiration changes may already be under way, but
   direct observational constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until
   such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on land-a key
   diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and
   variability-remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of
   global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008, compiled using a
   global monitoring network(3), meteorological and remote-sensing
   observations, and a machine-learning algorithm(4). In addition, we have
   assessed evapotranspiration variations over the same time period using
   an ensemble of process-based land-surface-models. Our results suggest
   that global annual evapotranspiration increased on average by 7.1 +/-
   1.0 millimetres per year per decade from 1982 to 1997. After that,
   coincident with the last major El Nino event in 1998, the global
   evapotranspiration increase seems to have ceased until 2008. This change
   was driven primarily by moisture limitation in the Southern Hemisphere,
   particularly Africa and Australia. In these regions, microwave satellite
   observations indicate that soil moisture decreased from 1998 to 2008.
   Hence, increasing soil-moisture limitations on evapotranspiration
   largely explain the recent decline of the global land-evapotranspiration
   trend. Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is
   representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more
   permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for
   earth system science.},

Abstract = {Alpine plant-pollinator communities play an important role in the
   functioning of alpine ecosystems, which are highly threatened by climate
   change. However, we still have a poor understanding of how environmental
   factors and spatiotemporal variability shape these communities. Here, we
   investigate what drives structure and beta diversity in a
   plant-pollinator metacommunity from the Australian alpine region using
   two approaches: pollen DNA metabarcoding (MB) and observations.
   Individual pollinators often carry pollen from multiple plant species,
   and therefore we expected MB to reveal a more diverse and complex
   network structure. We used two gene regions (ITS2 and trnL) to identify
   plant species present in the pollen loads of 154 insect pollinator
   specimens from three alpine habitats and construct MB networks, and
   compared them to networks based on observations alone. We compared
   species and interaction turnover across space for both types of
   networks, and evaluated their differences for plant phylogenetic
   diversity and beta diversity. We found significant structural
   differences between the two types of networks; notably, MB networks were
   much less specialized but more diverse than observation networks, with
   MB detecting many cryptic plant species. Both approaches revealed that
   alpine pollination networks are very generalized, but we estimated a
   high spatial turnover of plant species (0.79) and interaction rewiring
   (0.6) as well as high plant phylogenetic diversity (0.68) driven by
   habitat differences based on the larger diversity of plant species and
   species interactions detected with MB. Overall, our findings show that
   habitat and microclimatic heterogeneity drives diversity and fine-scale
   spatial turnover of alpine plant-pollinator networks.},

Abstract = {Multiple environmental forcings, such as warming and changes in ocean
   circulation and nutrient supply, are affecting the base of Arctic marine
   ecosystems, with cascading effects on the entire food web through
   bottom-up control. Stable nitrogen isotopes (delta N-15) can be used to
   detect and unravel the impact of these forcings on this unique
   ecosystem, if the many processes that affect the delta N-15 values are
   constrained. Combining unique 60-year records from compound specific
   delta N-15 biomarkers on harp seal teeth alongside state-of-the-art
   ocean modelling, we observed a significant decline in the delta N-15
   values at the base of the Barents Sea food web from 1951 to 2012. This
   strong and persistent decadal trend emerges due to the combination of
   anthropogenic atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Atlantic, increased
   northward transport of Atlantic water through Arctic gateways and local
   feedbacks from increasing Arctic primary production. Our results suggest
   that the Arctic ecosystem has been responding to anthropogenically
   induced local and remote drivers, linked to changing ocean biology,
   chemistry and physics, for at least 60 years. Accounting for these
   trends in delta N-15 values at the base of the food web is essential to
   accurately detect ecosystem restructuring in this rapidly changing
   environment.},

Title = {Contrasting mechanisms of resilience at mesic and semi-arid boundaries
   of fynbos, a mega-diverse heathland of South Africa},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Biome boundaries are expected to be sensitive to changes in climate and
   disturbance, because it is here that ecological communities are at
   environmental, ecological or disturbance limits. Using palaeoecology to
   study ecosystem dynamics at biome boundaries provides opportunities for
   understanding ecosystem resilience or sensitivity at ecologically
   meaningful timescales, and under varying climatic and disturbance
   conditions.
   The fynbos biome is a megadiverse Mediterranean type shrubland, found
   only in South Africa, that is threatened by climate change, land-use
   change and invasion by alien species. We used palaeoecological records
   from the semi-arid and mesic boundaries of the fynbos biome to test
   hypotheses regarding ecosystem resilience over timescales of centuries
   to millennia. We hypothesised that fynbos would expand at its mesic
   boundary at the expense of afrotemperate forest under drier and / or
   more fire prone conditions. In contrast, we hypothesised that at the
   semi-arid boundary, fynbos would expand at the expense of succulent
   karoo under wetter and cooler and / or more fire-prone conditions.
   Contrary to our expectations, the fossil pollen record at both biome
   boundaries showed remarkable stability at centennial - millennial
   timescales. To explain our results, we generated new hypotheses
   exploring possible mechanisms that might confer resilience.
   At the mesic (temperate) boundary, we suggest that decreased seasonally
   of rainfall during drier phases favoured fire and fynbos persistence,
   while in wetter periods, increased seasonally of rainfall resulted in
   enhanced summer drought stress, inhibiting forest expansion. M this
   boundary, internal reorganisation from grassy to proteoid fynbos states
   conferred resilience through resistance. At the succulent karoo
   boundary, we suggest that increased aridly was offset by less seasonally
   of rainfall, which enhanced biomass and allowed fire to persist,
   favouring persistence of fynbos. At this boundary, fynbos sensu stricto
   retreated during arid phases but recovered during climate amelioration,
   consistent with resilience through recovery. In both cases, this
   mega-diverse, disturbance-adapted flora provided a range of traits that
   enabled fynbos to persist despite environmental perturbation. Our
   findings agree with general observations that for ecosystems in regions
   of ample resource availability (i.e. at the mesic boundary), biotic
   interactions and disturbance tend to become more important in ecosystem
   dynamics, whereas in regions of scarce resources (in this case water
   scarcity at the semi-arid boundary) abiotic stress is more important.
   Our findings contribute to debates over the mechanisms that confer
   resistance and resilience to environmental change. Understanding and
   conserving the processes and mechanisms underpinning its resilience will
   be critical to effective conservation planning.},

Title = {Impacts of increased sediment loads on the ecology of lakes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {84},
Number = {4},
Pages = {517-531},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Increased sediment loading comprises one of the most important and
   pervasive anthropogenic impacts on aquatic ecosystems globally. In spite
   of this, little is known of the overall effects of increased sediment
   loads on lakes. By modifying both bottom-up and top-down ecological
   processes and restructuring energy flow pathways, increased sediment
   loads not only alter biotic assemblage structure and ecological
   functioning significantly, but frequently result in reduced biological
   diversity and productivity. Although lake food-webs can be subsidised to
   some extent by the adsorption of organic carbon to fine sediments,
   trophic structure and the composition of biotic assemblages remain
   likely to be modified considerably. The mineralogy and particle size of
   sediments and the availability of nutrients, by influencing both the
   scale and nature of impacts, are key determinants of the overall effects
   of increased sediment loads on lake ecosystems. Although interactions
   with other global anthropogenic pressures, such as invasion by exotic
   species and climate change, are likely to be significant, little remains
   known about the nature or likely strength of those interactions.
   Widespread increases in sediment loading to lakes have, therefore,
   profound implications for the conservation and management of global
   aquatic biological diversity.},

Abstract = {Arctic marine ecosystems are undergoing rapid correction in response to
   multiple expressions of climate change, but the consequences of altered
   biodiversity for the sequestration, transformation and storage of
   nutrients are poorly constrained. Here, we determine the bioturbation
   activity of sediment-dwelling invertebrate communities over two
   consecutive summers that contrasted in sea-ice extent along a transect
   intersecting the polar front. We find a clear separation in community
   composition at the polar front that marks a transition in the type and
   amount of bioturbation activity, and associated nutrient concentrations,
   sufficient to distinguish a southern high from a northern low. While
   patterns in community structure reflect proximity to arctic versus
   boreal conditions, our observations strongly suggest that faunal
   activity is moderated by seasonal variations in sea ice extent that
   influence food supply to the benthos. Our observations help visualize
   how a climate-driven reorganization of the Barents Sea benthic ecosystem
   may be expressed, and emphasize the rapidity with which an entire region
   could experience a functional transformation. As strong benthic-pelagic
   coupling is typical across most parts of the Arctic shelf, the response
   of these ecosystems to a changing climate will have important
   ramifications for ecosystem functioning and the trophic structure of the
   entire food web. This article is part of the theme issue `The changing
   Arctic Ocean: consequences for biological communities, biogeochemical
   processes and ecosystem functioning'.},

Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Widespread ecological reorganizations and increases in organic carbon
   (OC) in lakes across the Northern Hemisphere have raised concerns about
   the impact of the ongoing climate warming on aquatic ecosystems and
   carbon cycling. We employed diverse biogeochemical techniques on a
   high-resolution sediment record from a subarctic lake in northern
   Finland (70 degrees N) to examine the direction, magnitude and mechanism
   of change in aquatic carbon pools prior to and under the anthropogenic
   warming. Coupled variation in the elemental and isotopic composition of
   the sediment and a proxy-based summer air temperature reconstruction
   tracked changes in aquatic production, depicting a decline during a cool
   climate interval between similar to 1700-1900 C.E. and a subsequent
   increase over the 20th century. OC accumulation rates displayed similar
   coeval variation with temperature, mirroring both changes in aquatic
   production and terrestrial carbon export. Increase in sediment organic
   content over the 20th century together with high inferred aquatic UV
   exposure imply that the 20th century increase in OC accumulation is
   primarily connected to elevated lake production rather than terrestrial
   inputs. The changes in the supply of autochthonous energy sources were
   further reflected higher up the benthic food web, as evidenced by biotic
   stable isotopic fingerprints.},

Title = {Globally invariant metabolism but density-diversity mismatch in
   springtails},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Soil life supports the functioning and biodiversity of terrestrial
   ecosystems. Springtails (Collembola) are among the most abundant soil
   arthropods regulating soil fertility and flow of energy through above-
   and belowground food webs. However, the global distribution of
   springtail diversity and density, and how these relate to energy fluxes
   remains unknown. Here, using a global dataset representing 2470 sites,
   we estimate the total soil springtail biomass at 27.5 megatons carbon,
   which is threefold higher than wild terrestrial vertebrates, and record
   peak densities up to 2 million individuals per square meter in the
   tundra. Despite a 20-fold biomass difference between the tundra and the
   tropics, springtail energy use (community metabolism) remains similar
   across the latitudinal gradient, owing to the changes in temperature
   with latitude. Neither springtail density nor community metabolism is
   predicted by local species richness, which is high in the tropics, but
   comparably high in some temperate forests and even tundra. Changes in
   springtail activity may emerge from latitudinal gradients in
   temperature, predation and resource limitation in soil communities.
   Contrasting relationships of biomass, diversity and activity of
   springtail communities with temperature suggest that climate warming
   will alter fundamental soil biodiversity metrics in different
   directions, potentially restructuring terrestrial food webs and
   affecting soil functioning.},

Title = {Decrease of Population Divergence in Eurasian Perch (<i>Perca</i>
   <i>fluviatilis</i>) in Browning Waters: Role of Fatty Acids and Foraging
   Efficiency},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},

Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {Due to altered biogeochemical processes related to climate change,
   highly colored dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial sources
   will lead to a water ``brownification{''} in many freshwater systems of
   the Northern Hemisphere. This will create deteriorated visual conditions
   that have been found to affect habitat-specific morphological variations
   in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) in a previous study. So far,
   potential drivers and ultimate causes of these findings have not been
   identified. We conducted a field study to investigate the connection
   between morphological divergence and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)
   composition of perch from six lakes across a gradient of DOC
   concentration. We expected a decrease in the prevalence of PUFAs, which
   are important for perch growth and divergence with increasing DOC
   concentrations, due to the restructuring effects of DOC on aquatic food
   webs. In general, rate of morphological divergence in perch decreased
   with increasing DOC concentrations. Proportions of specific PUFAs
   (22:6n-3, 18:3n-3, 20:5n-3, and 20:4n-6) identified to primarily
   contribute to overall differences between perch caught in clear and
   brown-water lakes tended to be connected to overall decline of
   morphological divergence. However, no overall significant relationship
   was found, indicating no severe limitation of essential fatty acids for
   perch inhabiting brown water lakes. We further broaden our approach by
   conducting a laboratory experiment on foraging efficiency of perch.
   Therefore, we induced pelagic and littoral phenotypes by differences in
   habitat-structure and feeding mode and recorded attack rate in a feeding
   experiment. Generally, fish were less efficient in foraging on littoral
   prey (Ephemeroptera) when visual conditions were degraded by brown water
   color. We concluded that browning water may have a strong effect on the
   forager's ability to find particular food resources, resulting in the
   reduced development of evolutionary traits, such as habitat-specific
   morphological divergence.},

Title = {No state change in pelagic fish production and biodiversity during the
   Eocene-Oligocene transition},
Journal = {NATURE GEOSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {238+},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) boundary (\~{}33.9 million years ago) has
   been described as a state change in the Earth system marked by the
   permanent glaciation of Antarctica and a proposed increase in oceanic
   productivity. Here we quantified the response of fish production and
   biodiversity to this event using microfossil fish teeth (ichthyoliths)
   in seven deep-sea sediment cores from around the world. Ichthyolith
   accumulation rate (a proxy for fish biomass production) shows no
   synchronous trends across the E/O. Ichthyolith accumulation in the
   Southern Ocean and Pacific gyre sites is an order of magnitude lower
   than that in the equatorial and Atlantic sites, demonstrating that the
   Southern Ocean was not a highly productive ecosystem for fish before or
   after the E/O. Further, tooth morphotype diversity and assemblage
   composition remained stable across the interval, indicating little
   change in the biodiversity or ecological role of open-ocean fish. While
   the E/O boundary was a major global climate-change event, its impact on
   pelagic fish was relatively muted. Our results support recent findings
   of whale and krill diversification suggesting that the pelagic ecosystem
   restructuring commonly attributed to the E/O transition probably
   occurred much later, in the late Oligocene or Miocene.
   Marine fish biomass and diversity did not change during the
   Eocene-Oligocene transition despite widespread cooling and Antarctic ice
   sheet expansion, according to microfossil fish teeth records from a set
   of deep-sea cores.},

Title = {Comparing the roles of Pacific halibut and arrowtooth flounder within
   the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem and fishing economy},
Journal = {FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {576-596},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The fishing industry of the western and central regions of the coastal
   Gulf of Alaska (CGoA) directly employs over 17,000 people and processes
   fish with a wholesale value of US\$618 million annually. Pacific halibut
   (Hippoglossus stenolepis) are a valued groundfish species because of the
   high quality of their flesh. In contrast, arrowtooth flounder
   (Atheresthes stomias) are much more abundant but of low value because
   their flesh degrades upon heating. Both are high trophic level predators
   but play different roles in the ecosystem because of differences in
   abundance and diet. Using an end-to-end ecosystem model, we evaluate the
   impact of alternate levels of fishing effort and large-scale changes in
   oceanographic conditions upon both species, the ecosystem, and the
   fishing economy. Reduction of longline efforts to reduce Pacific halibut
   mortality led to reduction in total value of all CGoA landings but
   increase in value landed by sport fisheries, trawl fleets, and fish pot
   vessels as they exploit a greater share of available halibut, sablefish,
   and Pacific cod. Increased trawl effort to raise arrowtooth flounder
   mortality led to increase in total value of all landings but large
   reductions in value landed by longline, jig, fish pot, and sport fleets
   with greater competition for available Pacific cod, halibut, and
   sablefish. Oceanographic conditions that enhance pelagic food chains at
   the expense of benthic food chains negatively impact groundfish in
   general, though Pacific halibut and arrowtooth flounder are resilient to
   these effects because of the high importance of pelagic fish in their
   diets.},

Title = {Context dependency of the density-body mass relationship in litter
   invertebrates along an elevational gradient},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {323-332},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {How community structure responds to environmental changes in space and
   time is a key concern in ecology. As a synthesized indicator of
   community structure, the density body mass (DBM) relationship reflecting
   body size distributions can serve as a linkage between community
   response and ecological processes and function. However, the drivers of
   the spatial and temporal shifts in the DBM relationship for brown food
   webs remain largely unknown. This study aimed to find the elevational
   pattern of body size distributions of litter invertebrate communities
   and understand the causes of climate and resource factors shaping this
   pattern in different spatio-temporal contexts. We identified the
   elevational pattern of body size distributions of litter invertebrates
   in a temperate montane forest and, for the first time, examined this
   pattern by taking account of the temporal contexts integrating the
   growing and dormant seasons. Furthermore, we assessed the relative roles
   of climate factors (i.e., temperature, light, and moisture) and resource
   factors (i.e., litter quality and quantity) in body size distribution
   patterns. In general, we demonstrated litter invertebrate communities
   were size-structured at all elevations and in different seasons, which
   underpins the DBM. However, the elevational patterns of the DBM slopes
   varied between seasons: In the growing season the DBM slopes were
   shallower with increasing elevation. Contrasting, the DBM slopes were
   steeper with increasing elevation in the dormant season. This is
   indicating that along the elevation, the larger litter invertebrates
   benefited more in the growing season compared with the smaller
   invertebrates, which benefited more in the dormant season. The drivers
   of the DBM relationship were context dependent: (1) temperature was a
   fundamental driver for the DBM relationship across space and time, with
   increasing temperature benefiting smaller invertebrates; (2) crown
   density only matters in the dormant season, with increasing light
   intensity benefiting larger invertebrates. No impact of soil moisture on
   the body size distributions was detected; and (3) litter availability
   impact varied with season in quality (i.e., litter C:N and C:S ratios)
   and quantity (i.e., litter amount), mainly functioning in the growing
   and the dormant season, respectively. This finding would enhance a more
   predictive understanding of how environmental change may restructure
   ecosystems and soil functioning from an allometric scaling perspective
   in the context of global warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Quaternary refugia are associated with higher speciation rates in
   mammalian faunas of the Western Palaearctic},

Abstract = {Quaternary climate changes have contributed to shape the biogeographic
   distribution of extant species. The combination of climatic niche
   conservatism and glacial-interglacial cycles forced many species to
   retract their range limits for surviving under the advance of
   Pleistocene ice-sheets. Refugia offered geographical opportunities for
   species to retreat, persist and, later on, begin recolonization
   processes under favourable environmental conditions. Here we explore the
   hypothesis that refugia have been not only crucial for the survival of
   multiple species but also acted as speciation centres for Western
   Palaearctic mammals. We define `recurrent massive refugia' as those
   geographical regions that have historically accumulated the highest
   levels of co-occurring species for several Quaternary cycles. Our
   assemblage-level analyses identify the existence of refugia within the
   Iberian Peninsula and the Atlantic French margin that were recurrently
   selected by most mammals. The topographic heterogeneity, climatic
   stability and microhabitat availability of these refugial areas may have
   offered suitable habitat conditions for multiple species during
   different climatic events over time. Using a Bayesian analysis of
   macroevolutionary mixtures we detected that the higher level of
   divergence and accumulative evolutionary changes in mammals of the
   Western Palaearctic are found in refugia. The continuous retractions and
   expansions of species' ranges during the Pleistocene promoted temporal
   changes in the composition and richness of communities in this
   biogeographic region. The reorganization of ecological composition
   driven by cyclical climatic events may have favoured the emergence of
   biotic interactions and ecological responses conducive to novel
   selective pressures. Our findings suggest, first, that multiple climatic
   changes in the form of glacial-interglacial transitions during the
   Quaternary have left a detectable imprint on the observed geographical
   patterns of species richness in mammalian faunas of the Western
   Palaearctic, and second, highlight the importance of refugia for the
   preservation of species ('museums') and as centers of speciation and
   endemism ('cradles') as well.},

Abstract = {The highly productive northern Bering and Chukchi marine shelf ecosystem
   has long been dominated by strong seasonality in sea-ice and water
   temperatures. Extremely warm conditions from 2017 into 2019-including
   loss of ice cover across portions of the region in all three
   winters-were a marked change even from other recent warm years.
   Biological indicators suggest that this change of state could alter
   ecosystem structure and function. Here, we report observations of key
   physical drivers, biological responses and consequences for humans,
   including subsistence hunting, commercial fishing and industrial
   shipping. We consider whether observed state changes are indicative of
   future norms, whether an ecosystem transformation is already underway
   and, if so, whether shifts are synchronously functional and system wide
   or reveal a slower cascade of changes from the physical environment
   through the food web to human society. Understanding of this observed
   process of ecosystem reorganization may shed light on transformations
   occurring elsewhere.
   Exceptionally warm years in 2017-2019 have caused changes in the
   physical and biological characteristics of the Pacific Arctic Ocean.
   What these changes mean for the ecosystem and societal consequences will
   depend on if they are evidence of a transformation or anomalies in the
   system.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of regime shifts in marine ecosystems has important
   implications for environmental legislation that requires setting
   reference levels and targets of quantitative restoration outcomes. The
   Baltic Sea ecosystem has undergone large changes in the 20(th) century
   related to anthropogenic pressures and climate variability, which have
   caused ecosystem reorganization. Here, we compiled historical
   information and identified relationships in our dataset using
   multivariate statistics and modeling across 31 biotic and abiotic
   variables from 1925 to 2005 in the Central Baltic Sea. We identified a
   series of ecosystem regime shifts in the 1930s, 1970s, and at the end of
   the 1980s/beginning of the 1990s. In the long term, the Central Baltic
   Sea showed a regime shift from a benthic to pelagic-dominated state.
   Historically, benthic components played a significant role in trophic
   transfer, while in the more recent productive system pelagic-benthic
   coupling was weak and pelagic components dominated. Our analysis shows
   that for the entire time period, productivity, climate, and hydrography
   mainly affected the functioning of the food web, whereas fishing became
   important more recently. Eutrophication had far-reaching direct and
   indirect impacts from a long-term perspective and changed not only the
   trophic state of the system but also affected higher trophic levels. Our
   study also suggests a switch in regulatory drivers from salinity to
   oxygen. The ``reference ecosystem{''} identified in our analysis may
   guide the establishment of an ecosystem state baseline and threshold
   values for ecosystem state indicators of the Central Baltic Sea.},

Title = {Using mixing models to study human paleodiets in central-western Santa
   Cruz (Argentina) during Late Holocene},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OSTEOARCHAEOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 8},
Abstract = {During the final Late Holocene, there was a socio-economic
   reorganization among the people in the central-western of Santa Cruz,
   Argentina. Analysis of bone collagen revealed that hunter-gatherer
   groups maintained a consistent diet rich in steppe animal protein for
   the past 3000 years. However, there was a change in bioapatite \&
   delta;C-13 values in the last 1000 years, indicating a shift in the
   whole diet that was not reflected in the protein component. This article
   seeks to evaluate the differential consumption of resources over time
   and between sexes among hunter-gatherer populations in the region. A
   total of 39 adult individuals of both sexes, recovered from stone burial
   structures with different chronologies, were analyzed. Quantitative diet
   reconstruction was achieved through the use of the Bayesian mixing model
   known as Food Reconstruction Using Isotopic Transferred Signals
   (FRUITS). The results show that the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) was the most
   consumed animal throughout the studied period, considering both temporal
   and sex differences. Additionally, there is an increased importance of
   plant consumption in the last millennium, particularly among females.
   However, this can be the result of overrepresentation of this resource
   in our food web samples, due to the impossibility of resolving the
   origin of the carbon for the formation of bioapatite values.},

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {287},

Abstract = {Climate change is altering the biogeochemical and physical
   characteristics of the Arctic marine environment, which impacts sea ice
   algal and phytoplankton bloom dynamics and the vertical transport of
   these carbon sources to benthic communities. Little is known about
   whether the contribution of sea ice-derived carbon to benthic fauna and
   nitrogen cycling has changed over multiple decades in concert with
   receding sea ice. We combined compound-specific stable isotope analysis
   of amino acids with highly branched isoprenoid diatom lipid biomarkers
   using archived (1982-2016) tissue of benthivorous Atlantic walrus to
   examine temporal trends of sea ice-derived carbon, nitrogen isotope
   baseline and trophic position of Atlantic walrus at high- and
   mid-latitudes in the Canadian Arctic. Associated with an 18\% sea ice
   decline in the mid-Arctic, sea ice-derived carbon contribution to
   Atlantic walrus decreased by 75\% suggesting a strong decoupling of sea
   ice-benthic habitats. By contrast, a nearly exclusive amount of sea
   ice-derived carbon was maintained in high-Arctic Atlantic walrus (98\%
   in 1996 and 89\% in 2006) despite a similar percentage in sea ice
   reduction. Nitrogen isotope baseline or the trophic position of Atlantic
   walrus did not change over time at either location. These findings
   indicate latitudinal differences in the restructuring of carbon energy
   sources used by Atlantic walrus and their benthic prey, and in turn a
   change in Arctic marine ecosystem functioning between sea
   ice-pelagic-benthic habitats.},

Title = {Plastic leachates impair picophytoplankton and dramatically reshape the
   marine microbiome},
Journal = {MICROBIOME},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Background: Each year, approximately 9.5 million metric tons of plastic
   waste enter the ocean with the potential to adversely impact all trophic
   levels. Until now, our understanding of the impact of plastic pollution
   on marine microorganisms has been largely restricted to the microbial
   assemblages that colonize plastic particles. However, plastic debris
   also leaches considerable amounts of chemical additives into the water,
   and this has the potential to impact key groups of planktonic marine
   microbes, not just those organisms attached to plastic surfaces.
   Results: To investigate this, we explored the population and genetic
   level responses of a marine microbial community following exposure to
   leachate from a common plastic (polyvinyl chloride) or zinc, a specific
   plastic additive. Both the full mix of substances leached from polyvinyl
   chloride (PVC) and zinc alone had profound impacts on the taxonomic and
   functional diversity of our natural planktonic community. Microbial
   primary producers, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, which comprise the
   base of the marine food web, were strongly impaired by exposure to
   plastic leachates, showing significant declines in photosynthetic
   efficiency, diversity, and abundance. Key heterotrophic taxa, such as
   SAR11, which are the most abundant planktonic organisms in the ocean,
   also exhibited significant declines in relative abundance when exposed
   to higher levels of PVC leachate. In contrast, many copiotrophic
   bacteria, including members of the Alteromonadales, dramatically
   increased in relative abundance under both exposure treatments.
   Moreover, functional gene and genome analyses, derived from metagenomes,
   revealed that PVC leachate exposure selects for fast-adapting, motile
   organisms, along with enrichment in genes usually associated with
   pathogenicity and an increased capacity to metabolize organic compounds
   leached from PVC.
   Conclusions: This study shows that substances leached from plastics can
   restructure marine microbial communities with the potential for
   significant impacts on trophodynamics and biogeochemical cycling. These
   findings substantially expand our understanding of the ways by which
   plastic pollution impact life in our oceans, knowledge which is
   particularly important given that the burden of plastic pollution in the
   marine environment is predicted to continue to rise.},

Title = {Long-term oceanographic and ecological research in the western English
   Channel},
Booktitle = {ADVANCES IN MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 47},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {1-105},
Abstract = {Long-term research in the western English Channel, undertaken by the
   marine laboratories in Plymouth, is described and details of survey
   methods, sites, and time series given in this chapter. Major findings
   are summarized and their limitations outlined. Current research, with
   recent reestablishment and expansion of many sampling programmes, is
   presented, and possible future approaches are indicated. These unique
   long-term data sets provide an environmental baseline,for predicting
   complex ecological responses to local, regional, and global
   environmental change.
   Between 1888 and the present, investigations have been carried out into
   the physical, chemical, and biological components (ranging from plankton
   and fish to benthic and intertidal assemblages) of the western English
   Channel ecosystem. The Marine Biological Association of the United
   Kingdom has performed the main body of these observations. More recent
   contributions come from the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey, now the
   Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, dating from 1957; the
   Institute for Marine Environmental Research, from 1974 to 1987; and the
   Plymouth Marine Laboratory, which was formed by amalgamation of the
   Institute for Marine Environmental Research and part of the Marine
   Biological Association,,from 1988. Together, these contributions
   constitute a unique data series-one of the longest and most
   comprehensive samplings of enviromnental and marine biological variables
   in the world. Since the termination of many of these time series in
   1987-1988 during a reorganisation of UK marine research, there has been
   a resurgence of interest in long-term environmental change. Many
   programmes have been restarted and expanded with support from several
   agencies.
   The observations span significant periods of warming (1921-1961;
   1985-present) and cooling (1962-1980). During these periods of change,
   the abundance of key species underwent dramatic shifts. The first period
   of warming saw changes in zooplankton, pelagic fish, and larval fish,
   including the collapse of an important herring fishery. During later
   periods of change, shifts in species abundances have been reflected in
   other assemblages, such as the intertidal zone and the benthic fauna.
   Many of these changes appear to be related to climate, manifested as
   temperature changes, acting directly or indirectly. The hypothesis that
   climate is a forcing factor is widely supported today and has been
   reinforced by recent studies that show, responses of marine organisms to
   climatic attributes such as the strength of the North Atlantic
   Oscillation.
   The long-term data also yield important insights into the effects of
   anthropogenic disturbances such as fisheries exploitation and pollution.
   Comparison of demersal fish hauls over time highlights fisheries effects
   not only on commercially important species but also on the entire
   demersal community. The effects of acute ({''}Torrey Canyon{''} oil
   spill) and chronic (tributyltin {[}TBT] antifoulants) pollution are
   clearly seen in the intertidal records.
   Significant advances in diverse scientific disciplines have been
   generated from research undertaken alongside the long-term data series.
   Many concepts in marine biological textbooks have originated in part
   from this work (e.g. the seasonal cycle of plankton, the cycling of
   nutrients, the pelagic food web trophic interactions, and the influence
   of hydrography on pelagic communities). Associated projects currently
   range.from studies of marine viruses and bacterial ecology to
   zooplankton feeding dynamics and validation of ocean colour satellite
   sensors.
   Recent advances in technology mean these long-term programmes are more
   valuable than ever before. New technology collects data on finer
   temporal and spatial scales and can be used to capture processes that
   operate on multiple scales and hell) determine their influence in the
   marine environment. The MBA has been in the forefront of environmental
   modelling of sheaf seas since the early 1970s. Future directions being
   pursued include the continued development of coupled physical-ecosystem
   models using western English Channel time-series data. These models will
   include both the recent high-resolution data and the long-term
   time-series information to predict effects of future climate change
   scenarios. It, would be beneficial to provide more spatial and
   high-resolution temporal context to these data, which are fundamental
   for capturing processes that operate at multiple scales and
   understanding hoiv they operate within the marine environment. This is
   being achieved through employment of technologies such as
   sateillite-derived information and advanced telemetry instruments that
   pro vide real-time in situ profile data from the water column.},

Abstract = {Millions of lakes worldwide are distributed at latitudes or elevations
   resulting in the formation of lake ice during winter. Lake ice affects
   the transfer of energy, heat, light, and material between lakes and
   their surroundings creating an environment dramatically different from
   open-water conditions. While this fundamental restructuring leads to
   distinct gradients in ions, dissolved gases, and nutrients throughout
   the water column, surprisingly little is known about the resulting
   effects on ecosystem processes and food webs, highlighting the lack of a
   general limnological framework that characterizes the structure and
   function of lakes under a gradient of ice cover. Drawing from the
   literature and three novel case studies, we present the Lake Ice
   Continuum Concept (LICC) as a model for understanding how key aspects of
   the physical, chemical, and ecological structure and function of lakes
   vary along a continuum of winter climate conditions mediated by ice and
   snow cover. We examine key differences in energy, redox, and ecological
   community structure and describe how they vary in response to shifts in
   physical mixing dynamics and light availability for lakes with ice and
   snow cover, lakes with clear ice alone, and lakes lacking winter ice
   altogether. Global change is driving ice covered lakes toward not only
   warmer annual average temperatures but also reduced, intermittent or no
   ice cover. The LICC highlights the wide range of responses of lakes to
   ongoing climate-driven changes in ice cover and serves as a reminder of
   the need to understand the role of winter in the annual aquatic cycle.},

Abstract = {A growing number of studies report an increase in jellyfish populations
   worldwide that may have consequences for marine planktonic food web
   dynamics. The principal objective of this study was to understand the
   changes in a zooplankton community during blooms of Liriope tetraphylla
   and subsequent mucilage events in the Sea of Marmara, a small highly
   stratified transitional basin between the Black and Aegean Seas. Liriope
   blooms observed in 2006 and 2007 reached a maximum abundance of 2978
   ind.<bold>m(</bold>-3), following the species' first observation in
   2005. Jellyfish species are known to play a key guild role by
   restructuring plankton communities and in the Sea of Marmara Liriope
   caused a temporal regime shift from a crustacean- to a
   jellyfish-controlled system. A rapid decline in abundance of most
   important zooplankton species followed the Liriope increase, together
   with a drastic shift in community structure. The dominant summer-autumn
   species Penilia avirostris (Cladocera) vanished in the autumn of 2006
   and was diminished similar to 30-fold in 2007 when compared with years
   without Liriope. The decline in zooplankton and the devastating effects
   of mucilage on pelagic ecosystem and socio-economics through restricting
   commercial fisheries implied sensitivity of the already perturbed
   Marmara ecosystem to changes in predator densities and environmental
   stability.},

Abstract = {Climate change may increase both stratification and upwelling in marine
   ecosystems, but these processes may affect productivity in opposing or
   complementary ways. For the Southern California region of the California
   Current Ecosystem (CCE), we hypothesized that changes in stratification
   and upwelling have affected marine bird populations indirectly through
   changes in prey availability. To test this hypothesis, we derived trends
   and associations between stratification and upwelling, the relative
   abundance of potential prey including krill and forage fish, and
   seabirds based on the long-term, multi-disciplinary CalCOFI/CCE-LTER
   program. Over the period 1987 through 2011, spring and summer seabird
   density (all species combined) declined by similar to 2\% per year,
   mostly in the northern sector of the study region. Krill showed variable
   trends with two species increasing and one deceasing, resulting in
   community reorganization. Nearshore forage fish, dominated by northern
   anchovy (Engraulis mordax) as well as offshore mesopelagic species, show
   declines in relative abundance over this period. The unidirectional
   decline in springtime seabird density is largely explained by declining
   nearshore fish abundance in the previous season (winter). Interannual
   variability in seabird density, especially in the 2000s, is explained by
   variability in krill abundance. Changes in the numerical responses of
   seabirds to prey abundance correspond to a putative ecosystem shift in
   1998-1999 and support aspects of optimal foraging (diet) theory.
   Predator-prey interactions and numerical responses clearly explain
   aspects of the upper trophic level patterns of change in the pelagic
   ecosystem off southern California. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Estuaries are among the most valuable aquatic systems by their services
   to human welfare. However, increasing human activities at the watershed
   along with the pressure of climate change are fostering the
   co-occurrence of multiple environmental drivers, and warn of potential
   negative impacts on estuaries resources. At present, no clear
   understanding of how coastal ecosystems will respond to the
   non-stationary effect of multiple drivers. Here we analysed the temporal
   interaction among multiple environmental drivers and their changing
   priority on shaping phytoplankton response in the Bahia Blanca Estuary,
   SW Atlantic Ocean. The interaction among environmental drivers and the
   number of significant direct and indirect effects on chlorophyll
   concentration increased over time in concurrence with enhanced
   anthropogenic stress, changing winter climate and wind patterns. Over
   the period 1978-1993, proximal variables such as nutrients, water
   temperature and salinity, showed a dominant effect on chlorophyll,
   whereas in more recent years (1993-2009) climate signals (SAM and ENSO)
   boosted indirect effects through its influence on precipitation, wind,
   water temperature and turbidity. Turbidity emerged as the dominant
   driver of chlorophyll while in recent years acted synergistically with
   the concentration of dissolved nitrogen. As a result, chlorophyll
   concentration showed a significant negative trend and a loss of seasonal
   peaks reflecting a pronounced reorganisation of the phytoplankton
   community. We stress the need to account for the changing priority of
   drivers to understand, and eventually forecast, biological responses
   under projected scenarios of global anthropogenic change. (C) 2017

Title = {Long-term changes in phytoplankton phenology and community structure in
   the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},

Number = {12},
Pages = {2703-2716},

Abstract = {The phytoplankton of the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina, has been
   surveyed since 1978. Chlorophyll a, phytoplankton abundance, species
   composition and physico-chemical variables have been fortnightly
   recorded. From 1978 to 2002, a single winter-early spring diatom bloom
   has dominated the main pattern of phytoplankton interannual variability.
   Such pattern showed noticeable changes since 2006: the absence of the
   typical winter bloom and changes in phenology, together with the
   replacement of the dominant blooming species, i.e. Thalassiosira
   curviseriata, and the appearance of different blooming species, i.e.
   Cyclotella sp. and Thalassiosira minima. The new pattern showed
   relatively short-lived diatom blooms that spread throughout the year. In
   addition, shifts in the phytoplankton size structure toward small-sized
   diatoms, including the replacement of relatively large Thalassiosira
   spp. by small Cyclotella species and Chaetoceros species have been
   noticed. The changes in the phenology and composition of the
   phytoplankton are mainly attributed to warmer winters and the extremely
   dry weather conditions evidenced in recent years in the Bahia Blanca
   area. Changing climate has modified the hydrological features in the
   inner part of the estuary (i.e. higher temperatures and salinities) and
   potentially triggered the reorganization of the phytoplankton community.
   This long-term study provides evidence on species-specific and
   structural changes at the bottom of the pelagic food web likely related
   to the recent hydroclimatic conditions in a temperature estuary of the
   southwestern Atlantic.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic stressors are predicted to alter biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning worldwide. However, scaling up from species to
   ecosystem responses poses a challenge, as species and functional groups
   can exhibit different capacities to adapt, acclimate, and compensate
   under changing environments. We used a naturally acidified seagrass
   ecosystem (the endemic Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica) as a model
   system to examine how ocean acidification (OA) modifies the community
   structure and functioning of plant detritivores, which play vital roles
   in the coastal nutrient cycling and food web dynamics. In seagrass beds
   associated with volcanic CO2 vents (Ischia, Italy), we quantified the
   effects of OA on seagrass decomposition by deploying litterbags in three
   distinct pH zones (i.e., ambient, low, extreme low pH), which differed
   in the mean and variability of seawater pH. We replicated the study in
   two discrete vents for 117 days (litterbags sampled on day 5, 10, 28,
   55, and 117). Acidification reduced seagrass detritivore richness and
   diversity through the loss of less abundant, pH-sensitive species but
   increased the abundance of the dominant detritivore (amphipod Gammarella
   fucicola). Such compensatory shifts in species abundance caused more
   than a threefold increase in the total detritivore abundance in lower pH
   zones. These community changes were associated with increased
   consumption (52\%-112\%) and decay of seagrass detritus (up to 67\%
   faster decomposition rate for the slow-decaying, refractory detrital
   pool) under acidification. Seagrass detritus deployed in acidified zones
   showed increased N content and decreased C:N ratio, indicating that
   altered microbial activities under OA may have affected the decay
   process. The findings suggest that OA could restructure consumer
   assemblages and modify plant decomposition in blue carbon ecosystems,
   which may have important implications for carbon sequestration, nutrient
   recycling, and trophic transfer. Our study highlights the importance of
   within-community response variability and compensatory processes in
   modulating ecosystem functions under extreme global change scenarios.},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification affects with special intensity Arctic ecosystems,
   being marine photosynthetic organisms a primary target, although the
   consequences of this process in the carbon fluxes of Arctic algae are
   still unknown. The alteration of the cellular carbon balance due to
   physiological acclimation to an increased CO2 concentration (1300 ppm)
   in the common Arctic brown seaweeds Desmarestia aculeata and Alaria
   esculenta from Kongsfjorden (Svalbard) was analysed. Growth rate of D.
   aculeata was negatively affected by CO2 enrichment, while A. esculenta
   was positively affected, as a result of a different reorganization of
   the cellular carbon budget in both species. Desmarestia aculeata showed
   increased respiration, enhanced accumulation of storage biomolecules and
   elevated release of dissolved organic carbon, whereas A. esculenta
   showed decreased respiration and lower accumulation of storage
   biomolecules. Gross photosynthesis (measured both as O-2 evolution and
   C-14 fixation) was not affected in any of them, suggesting that
   photosynthesis was already saturated at normal CO2 conditions and did
   not participate in the acclimation response. However, electron transport
   rate changed in both species in opposite directions, indicating
   different energy requirements between treatments and species
   specificity. High CO2 levels also affected the N-metabolism, and C-13
   isotopic discrimination values from algal tissue pointed to a
   deactivation of carbon concentrating mechanisms. Since increased CO2 has
   the potential to modify physiological mechanisms in different ways in
   the species studied, it is expected that this may lead to changes in the
   Arctic seaweed community, which may propagate to the rest of the food
   web.},

Title = {Hotspots of biotic compositional change in lakes along vast latitudinal

Abstract = {Ecotones mark zones of rapid change in ecological structure at various
   spatial scales. They are believed to be particularly susceptible to
   shifts caused by environmental transformation, making them key regions
   for studying the effects of global change. Here, we explored the
   variation in assemblage structure of aquatic primary producer and
   consumer communities across latitudinal transects in northeastern North
   America (Quebec-Labrador) to identify spatial patterns in biodiversity
   that indicated the location of transition zones across the landscape. We
   analyzed species richness and the cumulative rate of compositional
   change (expressed as beta-diversity) of diatoms and chironomids to
   detect any abrupt shifts in the rate of spatial taxonomic turnover. We
   used principal coordinates analysis to estimate community turnover with
   latitude, then applied piecewise linear regression to assess the
   position of ecotones. Statistically significant changes in assemblage
   composition occurred at 52 and 55 degrees N, corresponding to the
   transition between closed- and open-crown forest, and to the southern
   onset of the forest tundra (i.e., the forest limit), respectively. The
   spatial distribution of ecotones was most strongly related to air
   temperature for chironomids and to vegetation- and soil-related chemical
   attributes of lake water for diatoms, including dissolved organic carbon
   content and water color. Lakes at mid- to high-latitudes currently face
   pressures from rapidly rising temperatures, accompanied by large
   increases in organic carbon inputs from their catchments, often leading
   to browning and its associated effects. The biota at the base of food
   webs in lakes located in transition zones are disproportionately
   affected by the cascading effects of these multi-factorial changes,
   concurrent with pronounced terrestrial greening observed in these
   regions. Similar patterns of biotic shifts have been observed along
   alpine aquatic transects, indicating the potential for widespread
   restructuring of cold, high-altitude and high-latitude freshwater
   communities due to global change.},

Title = {The near future of coral reefs},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {460-483},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper the current status of coral reefs, predictions concerning
   the ecological state of coral reefs to the 2025 time horizon and the
   research needs that can help understanding and management activities
   that might alleviate detrimental ecological changes are evaluated and
   discussed. The present rate of CO2 emissions will produce an atmospheric
   concentration in 100 years not experienced during the past 20 million
   years and water temperatures above those of the past interglacial 130
   000 years before present. Human influences on water temperatures,
   seawater chemistry (toxic substances, nutrients and aragonite
   saturation), the spread of diseases, removal of species and food web
   alterations are presently changing reef ecology. A significant
   ecological reorganization is underway and changes include a reduction in
   calcifying and zooxanthellae-hosting organisms, their obligate
   symbionts, and species at higher trophic levels, with an increase in
   generalist species of low trophic level that are adapted to variable
   environments. Late-successional fleshy brown algae of low net
   productivity or non-commercial invertebrates such as sea urchins,
   starfish and coral-eating snails will dominate many reefs. These changes
   will be associated with a loss of both net benthic and fisheries
   production and inorganic carbonate deposition; this will reduce reef
   complexity, species richness, reef growth and increase shoreline
   erosion. To avert these changes management is needed at both global and
   local levels. Both levels need to reduce greenhouse gases and other
   waste emissions and renew efforts to improve resource management
   including restrictions on the use of resources and globalization of
   resource trade, run-off and waste production, and balancing potential
   reef production and resource consumption.},

Title = {Carbon dioxide removal via macroalgae open-ocean mariculture and
   sinking: an Earth system modeling study},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {185-221},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {In this study, we investigate the maximum physical and biogeochemical
   potential of macroalgae open-ocean mariculture and sinking (MOS) as an
   ocean-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) method. Embedding a macroalgae
   model into an Earth system model, we simulate macroalgae mariculture in
   the open-ocean surface layer followed by fast sinking of the carbon-rich
   macroalgal biomass to the deep seafloor (depth > 3000 m), which assumes
   no remineralization of the harvested biomass during the quick sinking.
   We also test the combination of MOS with artificial upwelling (AU),
   which fertilizes the macroalgae by pumping nutrient-rich deeper water to
   the surface. The simulations are done under RCP 4.5, a
   moderate-emissions pathway. When deployed globally between years 2020
   and 2100, the carbon captured and exported by MOS is 270 PgC, which is
   further boosted by AU of 447 PgC. Because of feedbacks in the Earth
   system, the oceanic carbon inventory only increases by 171.8 PgC (283.9
   PgC with AU) in the idealized simulations. More than half of this carbon
   remains in the ocean after cessation at year 2100 until year 3000. The
   major side effect of MOS on pelagic ecosystems is the reduction of
   phytoplankton net primary production (PNPP) due to the competition for
   nutrients with macroalgae and due to canopy shading. MOS shrinks the
   mid-layer oxygen-minimum zones (OMZs) by reducing the organic matter
   export to, and remineralization in, subsurface and intermediate waters,
   while it creates new OMZs on the seafloor by oxygen consumption from
   remineralization of sunken biomass. MOS also impacts the global carbon
   cycle by reducing the atmospheric and terrestrial carbon reservoirs when
   enhancing the ocean carbon reservoir. MOS also enriches dissolved
   inorganic carbon in the deep ocean. Effects are mostly reversible after
   cessation of MOS, though recovery is not complete by year 3000. In a
   sensitivity experiment without remineralization of sunken MOS biomass,
   the whole of the MOS-captured carbon is permanently stored in the ocean,
   but the lack of remineralized nutrients causes a long-term nutrient
   decline in the surface layers and thus reduces PNPP. Our results suggest
   that MOS has, theoretically, considerable CDR potential as an
   ocean-based CDR method. However, our simulations also suggest that such
   large-scale deployment of MOS would have substantial side effects on
   marine ecosystems and biogeochemistry, up to a reorganization of food
   webs over large parts of the ocean.},
